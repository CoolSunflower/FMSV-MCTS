Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions related to the signal sda_pad_i from the provided list, ensuring maximum retention of assertions. They also emphasized including a width check if missing and not modifying the assertions themselves.

First, I need to go through each assertion in the given list and determine if it pertains to sda_pad_i. Let's look at each one:

1. **Assertion 1**: Checks that the bit width of sda_pad_i is 1. This directly involves sda_pad_i and is a width check. Definitely relevant.

2. **Assertion 2**: A property named sda_connectivity. It checks that when sda_pad_oe is 0, sda_pad_i equals sda_pad_o. This involves sda_pad_i and checks connectivity. Valid.

3. **Assertion 3**: Checks that sda_pad_i remains stable while SCL is high. This is a functional check for sda_pad_i during specific clock conditions. Relevant.

4. **Assertion 4**: Similar to assertion 2 but includes a disable iff (wb_rst_i). This is another version of the connectivity check with reset consideration. It's a variation but still valid and unique.

5. **Assertion 5**: Another stability check during SCL high but with more conditions (cr bits). This adds specific conditions but still pertains to sda_pad_i. Unique and valid.

6. **Assertion 6**: Checks for arbitration loss when sda_pad_i is low while the core is driving it high. This triggers a status bit. Functional check involving sda_pad_i.

7. **Assertion 7**: Checks for a start condition by monitoring sda_pad_i's fall. Relates to sda_pad_i's behavior during start commands.

8. **Assertion 8**: Checks for a stop condition via sda_pad_i's rise. Again, functional check for sda_pad_i.

Now, need to ensure uniqueness. Looking at assertion 2 and 4, they are similar but differ by the disable iff clause. Both should be retained as they handle different scenarios (with and without reset consideration). Similarly, assertion 3 and 5 both check stability during SCL high but with different conditions. Both are unique and valid.

The width assertion (1) is already present. No missing width checks here.

So the extracted assertions for sda_pad_i are numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. All are related to sda_pad_i and are unique in their conditions and properties. No duplicates. The width check is already covered by the first assertion, so nothing needs to be added.
