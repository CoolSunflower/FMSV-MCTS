Okay, let's start by looking at the user's query. They want me to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions for the signal wb_cyc_i from the provided list. The key points are to maximize retention without modification, include any width-related assertions, and ensure uniqueness.

First, I'll list out all the given assertions and check which ones are relevant to wb_cyc_i. The signal in question is wb_cyc_i, which is a 1-bit input indicating a valid bus cycle.

Looking at the provided assertions:

1. **assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i) wb_stb_i |-> wb_cyc_i);**  
   This checks that whenever wb_stb_i is asserted, wb_cyc_i must also be asserted. Valid and specific to wb_cyc_i.

2. **assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i) !wb_cyc_i |-> !wb_ack_o);**  
   Ensures that if wb_cyc_i is not active, then wb_ack_o should not be asserted. Relates to wb_cyc_i's effect on other signals.

3. **assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) ($bits(wb_cyc_i) == 1));**  
   Directly checks that wb_cyc_i is 1-bit wide. Critical to include as per the user's note about width assertions.

4. **property cyc_until_ack; ... endproperty assert property (cyc_until_ack);**  
   Different versions of this property check that wb_cyc_i remains active until an ack is received. These are valid and relate to wb_cyc_i's behavior during transactions.

5. **assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_stb_i |-> wb_cyc_i);**  
   Similar to the first assertion but without disable iff. Still valid and unique.

6. **property exact_2cycle_txn; ... endproperty**  
   Checks that a transaction completes in exactly 2 cycles. Part of the timing related to wb_cyc_i's role in transactions.

Next, check for uniqueness. Some assertions are repeated with slight variations, like different property names but same checks. For example, there are multiple instances of cyc_until_ack with different ranges. I need to list each unique one even if similar.

Width assertion is present as number 3, so that's covered. Also, the user emphasized not to modify any assertions, so I'll present them as-is, ensuring all unique ones are included, even if they seem similar but have different structures or conditions.

Now, compile all the assertions that mention wb_cyc_i and ensure they are unique. Remove any exact duplicates but keep those with different scopes or conditions. For example, the transaction_timing property specifies ##2 for ack, which is a specific case.

Finally, present all unique assertions in SystemVerilog code blocks as instructed.
