Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions related to the signal name clk_i from the given list. The goal is to maximize the number of retained assertions, ensuring that any assertion about the width of clk_i is included.

First, I need to go through each assertion provided and check if it's related to clk_i. The signal in question is clk_i, so I should look for any assertions that mention clk_i directly.

Looking at the list:

1. `assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(clk_i) == 1);`  
   This checks that clk_i is a 1-bit signal. Since the user mentioned including width checks, this is definitely relevant and must be included.

2. `assert property (@(posedge clk_i) tick |=> !tick);`  
   This is about the tick signal's behavior relative to clk_i, but not directly checking clk_i's properties. So probably not relevant here.

3. `assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $stable(tick) || $changed(tick));`  
   Again, involves tick and clk_i's edge, but not directly clk_i's properties. Not relevant.

4. The MTIME_INCREMENT_ON_TICK properties involve clk_i in their clocking events, but they primarily check mtime and step. Not directly clk_i assertions.

5. The TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT properties:  
   - `assert property (TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT);` where the property is `@(posedge clk_i) $changed(tick) |-> $rose(clk_i);`  
     This checks that tick changes only at the rising edge of clk_i. Since it's using clk_i as the clock, this is a valid assertion related to clk_i's edges.  

   - Another TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT: `@(negedge clk_i) !$changed(tick);`  
     This checks that tick doesn't change during the negedge of clk_i. Again, directly involves clk_i's edges and tick stability between edges. So this is another valid assertion for clk_i.

Other assertions related to TICK_PERIOD_CHECK or MTIME_STABILITY don't directly involve clk_i's properties beyond being the clocking event, which is standard. The main ones that pertain to clk_i are the ones checking its width and the alignment of tick changes with clk_i edges.

Now, compiling the unique ones:

1. The width check: `assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(clk_i) == 1);`  
2. The TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT that uses posedge clk_i and checks $rose(clk_i):  
   `assert property (TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT);` with the property definition as in the user's list.  
3. The TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT using negedge clk_i to ensure no tick changes:  
   `assert property (TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT);` with the negedge check.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the actual assertions are unique. Let me check the original list again for duplicates.

Looking at the user's list: the TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT appears twice. Once as:

'property TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT;\n  @(posedge clk_i) $changed(tick) |-> $rose(clk_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT);'

and another time as:

'property TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT;\n  @(negedge clk_i) !$changed(tick);\nendproperty\nassert property (TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT);'

These are two different properties with the same name, which isn't allowed in SystemVerilog. However, the user's list includes both as separate entries. But since they have different definitions, they should be considered separate assertions. Wait, but in reality, having two properties with the same name would be a conflict. However, the user provided them as separate entries, possibly as a mistake. But since the user wants all unique assertions, perhaps they are intended to be separate, even if they have the same name. But that's a problem. But the user's input may have such entries. So perhaps the user intended them as separate assertions with different contents. In that case, both should be included.

But when we look at the user's list, the actual properties with the same name but different content are two different assertions. So in the original list, the user has two versions of TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT. So I need to include both, even though they have the same name? Wait, in SystemVerilog, you can't have two properties with the same name in the same scope. So perhaps this is an error in the user's provided list. But assuming that the user provided these as separate assertions, perhaps one is using posedge and another negedge. So to maximize retained assertions, I should include both even if their names are the same. However, since the user is asking for unique assertions, maybe they are different.

Wait, looking at the actual code:

The first TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT is:

property TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT;
  @(posedge clk_i) $changed(tick) |-> $rose(clk_i); // Tick changes only at clock edges
endproperty
assert property (TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT);

The second is:

property TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT;
  @(negedge clk_i) !$changed(tick); // Tick remains stable between clock edges
endproperty
assert property (TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT);

These are two different properties, with the same name but different implementations. However, in practice, this would cause a compilation error due to duplicate property names. But since the user provided them as separate entries, perhaps they are different. Assuming that they are separate and valid (even though in reality they would conflict), the user wants them both included. Therefore, both should be considered unique.

But the user's instruction says to extract all unique and valid assertions. So even if two assertions have the same name but different content, they are considered different and should both be included if they are valid and related to clk_i.

So in this case, both TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT properties that check posedge and negedge are valid and related to clk_i. So they should both be included.

Additionally, the assertion `assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(clk_i) == 1);` checks the width of clk_i, which is required.

Therefore, the valid and unique assertions for clk_i are:

1. The width check.
2. The posedge TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT.
3. The negedge TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT.

Now, checking the original list again to ensure there are no other clk_i-related assertions. The other assertions don't directly relate to clk_i's properties beyond using it as a clock, which is standard. So these three are the ones to include.

Thus, the final answer includes the three assertions: the width check and the two TICK_CLOCK_ALIGNMENT properties (posedge and negedge versions).
