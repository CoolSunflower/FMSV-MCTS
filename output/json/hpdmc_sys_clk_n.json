        "Certainly! To provide a thorough reflection and critique of the System Verilog Assertions (SVAs) provided for `sys_clk_n`, let’s analyze each component of the answer step by step and identify potential flaws or areas for improvement. \n\n### 1. **Inversion Assertion**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nalways @(posedge sys_clk) begin\n    assert (sys_clk_n === 1'b0) else $error(\"sys_clk_n should be low when sys_clk is high\");\nend\n\nalways @(negedge sys_clk) begin\n    assert (sys_clk_n === 1'b1) else $error(\"sys_clk_n should be high when sys_clk is low\");\nend\n```\n\n**Critique:**\n- **Assertion Methodology:** The current assertion checks the inversion on `posedge` and `negedge` of `sys_clk`. This is adequate but can be enhanced by combining these checks into a single property to streamline the code and maintain consistency.\n- **Specific Edge Cases:** The assertions do not handle the cases where `sys_clk` might become high or low while `sys_clk_n` is transitioning, which could affect timing analysis. It is advisable to explicitly verify this condition within a timing window.\n- **Error Reporting:** The error messages are clear, but they should ideally include additional context (such as the current time) for easier debugging.\n\n### 2. **Timing Assertion**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty clock_relationship;\n    @ (posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) // Monitors both clock edges\n    disable iff (reset) // Considering a reset condition\n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0)); // Ensure sys_clk_n goes low after sys_clk rises\nendproperty\n\nassert property (clock_relationship) else $error(\"sys_clk_n and sys_clk timing relationship violated.\");\n```\n\n**Critique:**\n- **Invalid Temporal Logic:** The property may not accurately reflect the requirement that `sys_clk_n` should be low following `sys_clk` rising. The proper assertion should involve checking the timing of `sys_clk_n` relative to both edges of `sys_clk`.\n- **Correctness:** The comment is misleading; the property implies that both clocks should occur in sequence without asserting the need for a 180-degree phase shift. It may be better to express this relationship in a more explicit phase difference.\n- **Reset Condition Handling:** The `disable iff (reset)` clause is well-placed, but there should be additional considerations where clock signals should be stable even during reset conditions.\n\n### 3. **Jitter Monitoring**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nparameter JITTER_MAX = 1ns; // Define jitter threshold as per design requirement\nassert (abs($time - $last_posedge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX) else $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\nassert (abs($time - $last_negedge(sys_clk_n)) < JITTER_MAX) else $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk_n exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\n```\n\n**Critique:**\n- **Improper Use of `$time`**: The use of `$time` to calculate jitter is not appropriate as `$time` is global to the simulator and might not reflect the real-time differences between two clock edges. Instead, it should monitor the clock period or use a combination of time between consecutive edges directly.\n- **Missing Jitter Definition:** The definition of jitter must be clear regarding its implications on functionality. The parameters for `JITTER_MAX` should be derived from expected design constraints or specifications for clearer validity.\n- **Error Context:** Similar to previous assertions, error messages lack specific context (e.g., actual time values) to assist in quickly identifying the cause of failure.\n\n### 4. **General Structure and Clarity**\n- **Modularity**: The code can benefit from a more structured approach by grouping related properties together and providing better organization through comments or sections.\n- **Documentation**: Additional documentation or comments could improve readability and maintainability, explaining the intent behind each assertion clearly. \n\n### **Overall Feedback:**\n- **Conciseness vs. Clarity**: While the assertions capture primary behavior, there is a trade-off between conciseness and clarity. More verbose but clear definitions may be beneficial.\n- **Additional Assertions**: Consider adding assertions that specifically check for invalid conditions, such as both clocks being high or low simultaneously, which should never happen in a well-functioning differential clock system.\n- **Phase Relationship Checks**: Introduce assertions to more directly and accurately represent the phase relationship expectations. This could involve monitoring both clock edges within a defined timing window.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. Refactor the assertions to be encapsulated in properties for better modularity and clarity.\n2. Improve timing assertions to directly check the required phase relationship.\n3. Utilize time durations between clock edges instead of using `$time` for jitter monitoring.\n4. Improve error messages for better debugging context.\n\nBy making these changes, you can create a more robust and effective set of assertions for validating the behavior of `sys_clk_n` in relation to `sys_clk`.",
        "Certainly! Let’s analytically critique the proposed System Verilog Assertions (SVAs) for `sys_clk_n` from multiple angles, highlighting potential flaws or weaknesses and suggesting improvements step by step.\n\n### 1. **Inversion Verification**\n```systemverilog\nproperty inversion_check;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) \n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b0)) && \n    (sys_clk === 1'b0 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b1));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (inversion_check) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk_n should be the logical inverse of sys_clk.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Timing Sensitivity**: The assertion checks `sys_clk_n` only at the posedge of `sys_clk` or negedge of `sys_clk_n`. Ideally, this must strictly assert at the transitions of both clocks. It would be more comprehensive to check this for each edge.\n- **Redundant Checks**: The `sys_clk_n` check is triggered by both `posedge sys_clk` and `negedge sys_clk_n`, which might not cover all possible transition scenarios. Consider introducing separate assertions for each clock edge opportunistically to better catch logical or timing violations.\n- **Error Reporting**: The error message could be more descriptive, indicating exactly which condition failed, thus aiding debugging.\n\n### 2. **Timing Property**\n```systemverilog\nproperty clock_timing_relationship;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (clock_timing_relationship) else \n    $error(\"Timing relationship between sys_clk and sys_clk_n is violated.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Phase Relationships**: The assertion aims to check timing but may not fully validate the expected phase relationship because it only checks one transition's alignment. Additional assertions can be introduced to guarantee the timing across multiple cycles.\n- **Clarity**: Using `##1` indicates a one-time-step delay, which may raise questions about what guarantees are there that the two clocks maintain their relationship through subsequent cycles. \n\n### 3. **Jitter Monitoring**\n```systemverilog\nproperty jitter_monitor;\n    @(posedge sys_clk) \n    disable iff (reset) \n    (sys_clk -> ##1 (sys_clk_n[1:0] != sys_clk_n[1:0])) |-> \n    (abs($time - $last_posedge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX) &&\n    (abs($time - $last_negedge(sys_clk_n)) < JITTER_MAX);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (jitter_monitor) else \n    $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk or sys_clk_n exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Complexity**: The condition `(sys_clk_n[1:0] != sys_clk_n[1:0])` doesn't seem to effectively capture jitter analysis; it actually compares the two bits against themselves and adds no real value. Instead, consider tracking time intervals between edges.\n- **Jitter Definition**: Jitter is typically defined in terms of multiple clock cycles. Ensure that the definition aligns with industry metrics (e.g., asserting that the period of `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` is stable within a defined tolerance over a series of cycles).\n\n### 4. **No Overlap Assertion**\n```systemverilog\nproperty no_overlap;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    !(sys_clk && sys_clk_n);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (no_overlap) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk and sys_clk_n should never be high at the same time.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Signal Abstraction**: The focus on only the clock edges neglects to capture other scenarios that could lead to overlap, such as glitches or latch-up conditions. It may be beneficial to strengthen this assertion by checking for conditions over multiple clock cycles (e.g., checking over a window of ±1 clock cycle).\n- **Error Message**: As with previous assertions, enhancing error reporting clarity would help identify which specific transition caused the overlap.\n\n### 5. **General Improvements**\n- **Reset Conditions**: It’s good practice to include conditions ensuring the assertions have no false positives during reset states, but clarity on reset conditions could be improved by explicitly detailing them in each assertion.\n- **Assertions Structure and Modularity**: Grouping assertions regarding `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` can help keep the code organized, making it easier to maintain and validate the overall functionality.\n\n### **Revised SVA Suggestions**\nBased on the critiques, an improved version of the SVAs can be organized as follows:\n\n```systemverilog\n// Ensure sys_clk_n is the logical inverse of sys_clk on their respective edges\nproperty inversion_check;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) \n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b0)) and\n    (sys_clk === 1'b0 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b1));\nendproperty\nassert property (inversion_check) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk_n should be the logical inverse of sys_clk at each edge.\");\n\n// Ensure clocks maintain their phase relationship across multiple cycles\nproperty clock_phase_relationship;\n    @(posedge sys_clk)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0));\nendproperty\nassert property (clock_phase_relationship) else \n    $error(\"Phase relationship between sys_clk and sys_clk_n is violated.\");\n\n// Monitor jitter stability for both clocks\n// This can be more meaningful if we define intervals and check stability\nproperty jitter_stability;\n    @(posedge sys_clk) \n    disable iff (reset) \n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (abs($time - $last_edge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX));\nendproperty\nassert property (jitter_stability) else \n    $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk exceeds the maximum allowed value.\");\n\n// Ensure sys_clk and sys_clk_n never overlap\nproperty no_overlap;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    !(sys_clk && sys_clk_n);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_overlap) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk and sys_clk_n should never be high at the same time.\");\n```\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe revised assertions aim to address specific weaknesses identified in the original proposal. The improvements focus on clarity, comprehensiveness, and ensuring robust verification of the `sys_clk_n` signal in relation to `sys_clk`. The assertion structure has been made modular, facilitating easier debugging and understanding of the clock signal's expected behavior."

Therefore, assertions should monitor the stability of edges to detect any excessive jitter.\n\n5. **Setup and Hold Times**: Additional properties can assert that the setup and hold times for signals around these clock edges meet the specifications.\n\n### [Verification]\nThe following System Verilog Assertions are proposed to validate the behavior of `sys_clk_n`:\n\n```systemverilog\n// Assertion to check that sys_clk_n is the logical inversion of sys_clk\nproperty inversion_check;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) \n    disable iff (reset) // Ensure assertions are disabled during reset\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b0)) && \n    (sys_clk === 1'b0 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b1));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (inversion_check) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk_n should be the logical inverse of sys_clk.\");\n\n// Timing property to ensure both clocks have a defined timing relationship\nproperty clock_timing_relationship;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (clock_timing_relationship) else \n    $error(\"Timing relationship between sys_clk and sys_clk_n is violated.\");\n\n// Additional check for jitter limits\nparameter JITTER_MAX = 1ns; // Define a jitter threshold\nproperty jitter_monitor;\n    @(posedge sys_clk) \n    disable iff (reset) \n    (sys_clk -> ##1 (sys_clk_n[1:0] != sys_clk_n[1:0])) |-> \n    (abs($time - $last_posedge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX) &&\n    (abs($time - $last_negedge(sys_clk_n)) < JITTER_MAX);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (jitter_monitor) else \n    $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk or sys_clk_n exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\n\n// Assertion to ensure that both clocks never exceed their high/low states simultaneously\nproperty no_overlap;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    !(sys_clk && sys_clk_n);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (no_overlap) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk and sys_clk_n should never be high at the same time.\");\n```\n\n### [Answer]\nThese System Verilog Assertions are designed to monitor and validate the performance and integrity of the `sys_clk_n` signal in relation to `sys_clk`. They encapsulate key aspects of the clock's expected behavior, including logical inversion, timing relationships, jitter monitoring, and ensuring that the clock signals do not overlap.

            "Certainly! To provide a thorough reflection and critique of the System Verilog Assertions (SVAs) provided for `sys_clk_n`, let’s analyze each component of the answer step by step and identify potential flaws or areas for improvement. \n\n### 1. **Inversion Assertion**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nalways @(posedge sys_clk) begin\n    assert (sys_clk_n === 1'b0) else $error(\"sys_clk_n should be low when sys_clk is high\");\nend\n\nalways @(negedge sys_clk) begin\n    assert (sys_clk_n === 1'b1) else $error(\"sys_clk_n should be high when sys_clk is low\");\nend\n```\n\n**Critique:**\n- **Assertion Methodology:** The current assertion checks the inversion on `posedge` and `negedge` of `sys_clk`. This is adequate but can be enhanced by combining these checks into a single property to streamline the code and maintain consistency.\n- **Specific Edge Cases:** The assertions do not handle the cases where `sys_clk` might become high or low while `sys_clk_n` is transitioning, which could affect timing analysis. It is advisable to explicitly verify this condition within a timing window.\n- **Error Reporting:** The error messages are clear, but they should ideally include additional context (such as the current time) for easier debugging.\n\n### 2. **Timing Assertion**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty clock_relationship;\n    @ (posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) // Monitors both clock edges\n    disable iff (reset) // Considering a reset condition\n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0)); // Ensure sys_clk_n goes low after sys_clk rises\nendproperty\n\nassert property (clock_relationship) else $error(\"sys_clk_n and sys_clk timing relationship violated.\");\n```\n\n**Critique:**\n- **Invalid Temporal Logic:** The property may not accurately reflect the requirement that `sys_clk_n` should be low following `sys_clk` rising. The proper assertion should involve checking the timing of `sys_clk_n` relative to both edges of `sys_clk`.\n- **Correctness:** The comment is misleading; the property implies that both clocks should occur in sequence without asserting the need for a 180-degree phase shift. It may be better to express this relationship in a more explicit phase difference.\n- **Reset Condition Handling:** The `disable iff (reset)` clause is well-placed, but there should be additional considerations where clock signals should be stable even during reset conditions.\n\n### 3. **Jitter Monitoring**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nparameter JITTER_MAX = 1ns; // Define jitter threshold as per design requirement\nassert (abs($time - $last_posedge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX) else $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\nassert (abs($time - $last_negedge(sys_clk_n)) < JITTER_MAX) else $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk_n exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\n```\n\n**Critique:**\n- **Improper Use of `$time`**: The use of `$time` to calculate jitter is not appropriate as `$time` is global to the simulator and might not reflect the real-time differences between two clock edges. Instead, it should monitor the clock period or use a combination of time between consecutive edges directly.\n- **Missing Jitter Definition:** The definition of jitter must be clear regarding its implications on functionality. The parameters for `JITTER_MAX` should be derived from expected design constraints or specifications for clearer validity.\n- **Error Context:** Similar to previous assertions, error messages lack specific context (e.g., actual time values) to assist in quickly identifying the cause of failure.\n\n### 4. **General Structure and Clarity**\n- **Modularity**: The code can benefit from a more structured approach by grouping related properties together and providing better organization through comments or sections.\n- **Documentation**: Additional documentation or comments could improve readability and maintainability, explaining the intent behind each assertion clearly. \n\n### **Overall Feedback:**\n- **Conciseness vs. Clarity**: While the assertions capture primary behavior, there is a trade-off between conciseness and clarity. More verbose but clear definitions may be beneficial.\n- **Additional Assertions**: Consider adding assertions that specifically check for invalid conditions, such as both clocks being high or low simultaneously, which should never happen in a well-functioning differential clock system.\n- **Phase Relationship Checks**: Introduce assertions to more directly and accurately represent the phase relationship expectations. This could involve monitoring both clock edges within a defined timing window.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. Refactor the assertions to be encapsulated in properties for better modularity and clarity.\n2. Improve timing assertions to directly check the required phase relationship.\n3. Utilize time durations between clock edges instead of using `$time` for jitter monitoring.\n4. Improve error messages for better debugging context.\n\nBy making these changes, you can create a more robust and effective set of assertions for validating the behavior of `sys_clk_n` in relation to `sys_clk`."

Here are the key considerations:\n\n1. **Inversion Verification**: Since `sys_clk_n` is designed to be the complementary (inverted) version of `sys_clk`, we need assertions that check this logical relationship during clock transitions.\n\n2. **Duty Cycle and Phase Alignment**: To ensure proper differential signaling, it's critical that both `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` maintain similar duty cycles and a consistent 180-degree phase relationship.\n\n3. **Timing Validations**: Assert that the timing between the rising and falling edges of these clocks adheres to the necessary timing requirements to prevent signal integrity issues.\n\n4. **Jitter Monitoring**: Due to high-frequency operation, ensuring that both clocks exhibit minimal jitter is crucial. Therefore, assertions should monitor the stability of edges to detect any excessive jitter.\n\n5. **Setup and Hold Times**: Additional properties can assert that the setup and hold times for signals around these clock edges meet the specifications.\n\n### [Verification]\nThe following System Verilog Assertions are proposed to validate the behavior of `sys_clk_n`:\n\n```systemverilog\n// Assertion to check that sys_clk_n is the logical inversion of sys_clk\nproperty inversion_check;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) \n    disable iff (reset) // Ensure assertions are disabled during reset\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b0)) && \n    (sys_clk === 1'b0 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b1));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (inversion_check) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk_n should be the logical inverse of sys_clk.\");\n\n// Timing property to ensure both clocks have a defined timing relationship\nproperty clock_timing_relationship;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (clock_timing_relationship) else \n    $error(\"Timing relationship between sys_clk and sys_clk_n is violated.\");\n\n// Additional check for jitter limits\nparameter JITTER_MAX = 1ns; // Define a jitter threshold\nproperty jitter_monitor;\n    @(posedge sys_clk) \n    disable iff (reset) \n    (sys_clk -> ##1 (sys_clk_n[1:0] != sys_clk_n[1:0])) |-> \n    (abs($time - $last_posedge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX) &&\n    (abs($time - $last_negedge(sys_clk_n)) < JITTER_MAX);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (jitter_monitor) else \n    $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk or sys_clk_n exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\n\n// Assertion to ensure that both clocks never exceed their high/low states simultaneously\nproperty no_overlap;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    !(sys_clk && sys_clk_n);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (no_overlap) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk and sys_clk_n should never be high at the same time.\");\n```\n\n### [Answer]\nThese System Verilog Assertions are designed to monitor and validate the performance and integrity of the `sys_clk_n` signal in relation to `sys_clk`. They encapsulate key aspects of the clock's expected behavior, including logical inversion, timing relationships, jitter monitoring, and ensuring that the clock signals do not overlap. By embedding these assertions within your verification environment, you can achieve a robust and reliable check on differential signaling, thereby enhancing system stability during high-frequency operations with the SDRAM.": [
            "Certainly! Let’s analytically critique the proposed System Verilog Assertions (SVAs) for `sys_clk_n` from multiple angles, highlighting potential flaws or weaknesses and suggesting improvements step by step.\n\n### 1. **Inversion Verification**\n```systemverilog\nproperty inversion_check;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) \n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b0)) && \n    (sys_clk === 1'b0 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b1));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (inversion_check) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk_n should be the logical inverse of sys_clk.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Timing Sensitivity**: The assertion checks `sys_clk_n` only at the posedge of `sys_clk` or negedge of `sys_clk_n`. Ideally, this must strictly assert at the transitions of both clocks. It would be more comprehensive to check this for each edge.\n- **Redundant Checks**: The `sys_clk_n` check is triggered by both `posedge sys_clk` and `negedge sys_clk_n`, which might not cover all possible transition scenarios. Consider introducing separate assertions for each clock edge opportunistically to better catch logical or timing violations.\n- **Error Reporting**: The error message could be more descriptive, indicating exactly which condition failed, thus aiding debugging.\n\n### 2. **Timing Property**\n```systemverilog\nproperty clock_timing_relationship;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (clock_timing_relationship) else \n    $error(\"Timing relationship between sys_clk and sys_clk_n is violated.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Phase Relationships**: The assertion aims to check timing but may not fully validate the expected phase relationship because it only checks one transition's alignment. Additional assertions can be introduced to guarantee the timing across multiple cycles.\n- **Clarity**: Using `##1` indicates a one-time-step delay, which may raise questions about what guarantees are there that the two clocks maintain their relationship through subsequent cycles. \n\n### 3. **Jitter Monitoring**\n```systemverilog\nproperty jitter_monitor;\n    @(posedge sys_clk) \n    disable iff (reset) \n    (sys_clk -> ##1 (sys_clk_n[1:0] != sys_clk_n[1:0])) |-> \n    (abs($time - $last_posedge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX) &&\n    (abs($time - $last_negedge(sys_clk_n)) < JITTER_MAX);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (jitter_monitor) else \n    $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk or sys_clk_n exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Complexity**: The condition `(sys_clk_n[1:0] != sys_clk_n[1:0])` doesn't seem to effectively capture jitter analysis; it actually compares the two bits against themselves and adds no real value. Instead, consider tracking time intervals between edges.\n- **Jitter Definition**: Jitter is typically defined in terms of multiple clock cycles. Ensure that the definition aligns with industry metrics (e.g., asserting that the period of `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` is stable within a defined tolerance over a series of cycles).\n\n### 4. **No Overlap Assertion**\n```systemverilog\nproperty no_overlap;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    !(sys_clk && sys_clk_n);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (no_overlap) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk and sys_clk_n should never be high at the same time.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Signal Abstraction**: The focus on only the clock edges neglects to capture other scenarios that could lead to overlap, such as glitches or latch-up conditions. It may be beneficial to strengthen this assertion by checking for conditions over multiple clock cycles (e.g., checking over a window of ±1 clock cycle).\n- **Error Message**: As with previous assertions, enhancing error reporting clarity would help identify which specific transition caused the overlap.\n\n### 5. **General Improvements**\n- **Reset Conditions**: It’s good practice to include conditions ensuring the assertions have no false positives during reset states, but clarity on reset conditions could be improved by explicitly detailing them in each assertion.\n- **Assertions Structure and Modularity**: Grouping assertions regarding `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` can help keep the code organized, making it easier to maintain and validate the overall functionality.\n\n### **Revised SVA Suggestions**\nBased on the critiques, an improved version of the SVAs can be organized as follows:\n\n```systemverilog\n// Ensure sys_clk_n is the logical inverse of sys_clk on their respective edges\nproperty inversion_check;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) \n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b0)) and\n    (sys_clk === 1'b0 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b1));\nendproperty\nassert property (inversion_check) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk_n should be the logical inverse of sys_clk at each edge.\");\n\n// Ensure clocks maintain their phase relationship across multiple cycles\nproperty clock_phase_relationship;\n    @(posedge sys_clk)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0));\nendproperty\nassert property (clock_phase_relationship) else \n    $error(\"Phase relationship between sys_clk and sys_clk_n is violated.\");\n\n// Monitor jitter stability for both clocks\n// This can be more meaningful if we define intervals and check stability\nproperty jitter_stability;\n    @(posedge sys_clk) \n    disable iff (reset) \n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (abs($time - $last_edge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX));\nendproperty\nassert property (jitter_stability) else \n    $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk exceeds the maximum allowed value.\");\n\n// Ensure sys_clk and sys_clk_n never overlap\nproperty no_overlap;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    !(sys_clk && sys_clk_n);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_overlap) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk and sys_clk_n should never be high at the same time.\");\n```\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe revised assertions aim to address specific weaknesses identified in the original proposal. The improvements focus on clarity, comprehensiveness, and ensuring robust verification of the `sys_clk_n` signal in relation to `sys_clk`. The assertion structure has been made modular, facilitating easier debugging and understanding of the clock signal's expected behavior."

            "High Performance Dynamic Memory Controller\n\nSébastien Bourdeauducq\n\nDecember 2009\n\n1 Specifications\n\nThis controller is targeted at high bandwidth applications such as live video processing.\n\nIt is designed to drive 32-bit DDR SDRAM memory (which can be physically made up of two\n16-bit chips).\n\nThe memory contents are accessed through a 64-bit FML (Fast Memory Link) bus with a burst\nlength of 4. FML is a burst-oriented bus designed to ease the design of DRAM controllers. Its\nsignaling resembles WISHBONE, but basically removes all corner cases with burst modes to\nsave on logic resources and aspirin.\n\nHPDMC provides high flexibility and savings on hardware by implementing a bypass mode which\ngives the CPU low-level access to the SDRAM command interface (address pins, bank address\npins, and CKE, CS, WE, CAS and RAS). The SDRAM initialization sequence is assigned to the\nCPU, which should use this mode to implement it. Timing parameters are also configurable at\nruntime. These control interfaces are accessed on a 32-bit CSR bus, separate from the data bus.\nThe CSR bus is a proprietary bus designed for Milkymist that helps reduce the FPGA resource\nusage and avoid failed timing paths on the system bus.\n\nDue to the use of IDDR, ODDR and IDELAY primitives, HPDMC currently only supports the\nVirtex-4 FPGAs.\n\n2 Architecture\n\nFML CSR bus\n\nControl interface\n\nSDRAM management\nunit\n\nBypass Address &\nMUX Command Bus\n\nread_safe,\nwrite_safe, precharge_safe\n\nstb, we, adr\n\nread, write\nconcerned_bank\n\nData path controller\nBP\n\nFigure 1: Block diagram of the HPDMC architecture.\n\n2.1 Control interface\n\nThe control interface provides a register bank on a low-speed dedicated CSR bus, which is used\nto control the operating mode of the core, set timings, and initialize the SDRAM.\n\nThe interface can access directly the SDRAM address and command bus in the so-called bypass\nmode. In this mode, the memory controller is disabled and the CPU can control each pin of the\nSDRAM control bus through the bypass register.\n\nThis mode should be used at system boot-up to perform the SDRAM initialization sequence.\nHPDMC does not provide a hardware state machine that does such initialization.\n\nThe mapped registers are the following (addresses are in bytes to match the addresses seen by\nthe CPU when the CSR bus is bridged to Wishbone) :\n\n2.1.1 System register, offset 0x00\n\nBits Access | Default | Description\n\ni |Description\n0 RW Bypass mode enable. Setting this bit transfers control of the\nSDRAM command and address bus from HPDMC to the sys-\ntem CPU.

This bit should be cleared during normal operation and\nset while reconfiguring the memory subsystem.\n\n1\nRW 1\n2 RW 0 CKE control. This bit directly drives the CKE pin of the\nSDRAM and should be always set except during the first\nstage of the initialization sequence. The core does not sup-\nport SDRAM power-down modes, so clearing this bit during\nnormal operation results in undefined behaviour.\n— 0\n\n2.1.2 Bypass register, offset 0x04\n\nThe bypass register gives the system CPU low-level access to the SDRAM. It must be used\nat system power-up to initialize the SDRAM, as the controller does not provide this initializa-\ntion. Such software initialization of the SDRAM provides greater flexibility and saves valuable\nhardware resources.\n\nWriting once to this register issues one transaction to the SDRAM command bus, ie. the values\nwritten to the CS, WE, RAS and CAS bits are only taken into account for one clock cycle, and\nthen the signals go back to their default inactive state.\n\nThe values written to this register have an effect on the SDRAM only if the controller is put in\nbypass mode using the system register.\n\nDefaulk\n\nW CS control. Setting this bit activates the CS line of the\nSDRAM during the command transaction that results from\nwriting to the bypass register. As the SDRAM control bus is\nactive low, setting this bit actually puts a ’0’ logic level to the\nCS line.\n\nTW 0 WE control Game asabove.

When this register is written, the address pins change synchronously at the same time as\nthe command pins, so there is no need to pre-position the address bits before issuing a command.\nCommands like loading the mode register can therefore be performed with a single write to this\nregister.\n\n2.1.3 Timing register, offset 0x08\nThis register allows the CPU to tune the behaviour of HPDMC so that it meets SDRAM timing\nrequirements while avoiding unnecessary wait cycles.\n\nThe controller must be held in reset using the system register when the timing register is mod-\nified.\n\nBits Access | Default | Description\nNumber of clock cycles the scheduler must wait following a\nPrecharge command. Usually referred to as trp in SDRAM\ndatasheets.\n\n2 Number of clock cycles the scheduler must wait following an\nActivate command.

This is the time between\neach Auto Refresh command that is issued to the SDRAM,\nnot the delay between two consecutive refreshes of a particu-\nlar row. Usually referred to as trgrr in SDRAM datasheets,\nwhich is often 7.8js (64ms is an improbable value for this\nfield).\n\nNumber of clock cycles the controller must wait following\nan Auto Refresh command. Usually referred to as trrc in\nSDRAM datasheets.\n\nNumber of clock cycles the controller must wait following the\n\nlast data sent to the SDRAM during a write. Usually referred\nto as twr in SDRAM datasheets.\n\nReserved.\n\nNB. The default values are example only, and must be adapted to your particular setup.\n\n2.1.4 Delay register, offset 0x0C\n\nThis register controls the amount of delay that is introduced on the data lines when reading\nfrom memory. It directly controls the IDELAY elements that are inserted between the pins and\nthe IDDR registers.\n\nWriting once to the register toggles the IDELAY control signals once, that is to say, the signals\nwill be active for one clock cycle and then go back to their default zero state.\n\nThis register also controls the amount of phase shift that is introduced between the system clock\nand DQS (typically 90 degrees). HPDMC provides three signals, dgs_psen, dqs_psincdec and\ndqs_psdone that should be connected to the DCM used to generate the DQS clock which is\ncontrolled by this register.\n\nThe enable and incrementation bits work the same as for IDELAY. They should only be used\nwhen the ready bit (5) is set.\n\nDefault\n(oO [Ww fo | Resets delay to 0. If this bit is set, the others are ignored.\n\n1 W Increments or decrements delay by one tap (typically 78ps). If\nthe bit 2 is set at the same time this bit is written, the tap delay\nis incremented. Otherwise, it is decremented.\n\n2 W Selects between incrementation and decrementation of the input\n\nPP a eee\n\nIncrements or decrements the phase shift on DQS. If the bit 4\nis set at the same time this bit is written, the phase shift is\nincremented. Otherwise, it is decremented. The phase shift is\ntypically between -255 and 255 and is expressed in 1/256ths of\nthe clock period.\n\nSelects between incrementation and decrementation of the DQS\n\na a\n\nWhen this Tit is set, the DCM used to generate DQS is ready\n\nPp itis erator\n\n76 |R Retreives the values of the pll_ stat inputs of the core. These\ninputs are internally double-latched so that they can directly\naccept asynchronous signals. They are intended to monitor the\nlock status of the DCMs used to generate the SDRAM and DQS\nclocks.\n\n31-8 | — Reserved.\n\nThis register can be written to at any time.\n\n2.2 SDRAM management unit\n\nThe SDRAM management unit is a state machine which controls sequentially the SDRAM\naddress and command bus. Unless the core is in bypass mode, the management unit has full\ncontrol over the SDRAM bus.\n\nThis unit is responsible for precharging banks, activating rows, periodically refreshing the\nDRAM, and sending read and write commands to the SDRAM.\n\nIt has inputs connected to the control interface registers to retreive the trp, trcp, treryr and\ntreo timing values, as well as the row idle time.\n\nIt handles read and write requests through a port made up of four elements :\n\ne a strobe input\n\ne awrite enable input (which tells if the command to send to the SDRAM should be a read\nor a write)\n\ne an address input\n\ne an acknowledgement output\n\nThe protocol used on these signals is close to the one employed in Wishbone. The strobe signal\nindicates when a new command should be completed, and remains asserted (with other signals\nkept constant) until the acknowledgement signal is asserted. At the next clock cycle, a new\ncommand should be presented, or the strobe signal should be de-asserted.\n\nIn HPDMC, those signals are driven by the bus interface.\n\nThe management unit also signals the data path when it has sent a read or a write command\ninto the SDRAM. The signal is asserted exactly at the same time as the command is asserted.\n\nIt receives read_safe, write_safe and precharge_safe signals from the data path, whose\nmeanings are explained below.\n\n2.3. Data path controller\n\nThe data path controller is responsible for :\n\ne deciding the direction of the DQ and DQS pins\n\ne delaying read, write and precharge commands from the management unit that would create\nconflicts\n\nThe delaying of the commands is acheived through the use of three signals :\n\ne read_safe: when this signal is asserted, it is safe to send a Read command to the SDRAM.\nThis is used to prevent conflicts on the data bus : this signal is asserted when, taking into\naccount the CAS latency and the burst length, the resulting burst would not overlap the\ncurrently running one.\n\nwrite_safe : same thing, for the Write command.\n\nconcerned_bank[3..0] : when the management unit issues a Read or Write command,\nit must inform the data path controller about the bank which the transfer takes place in,\nusing this one-hot encoded signal.\n\ne precharge_safe[3..0] : when a bit in this signal is asserted, it is safe to precharge the\ncorresponding bank. The management unit must use this signal so as not to precharge a\nbank interrupting a read burst or causing a write-to-precharge violation.\n\nThe data path controller is also connected to the control interface, to retreive tyr and the CAS\nlatency.\n\n2.4 Data path\n\nData is captured from or sent to the SDRAM using IDDR and ODDR primitives, in order to limit\ntiming nightmares with ISE.\n\nWhen writing to the DDRAM, the ODDR primitive puts out data synchronously to the rising\nand falling edges of the system clock. This was chosen to ease timing between the FML (which\nis clocked by the system clock) and the I/O elements without introducing additional latency\ncycles. The data should therefore be strobed by DQS after a short time following each system\nclock edge. A delay corresponding to a 90 degrees phase shift gives the best margins, and can\nbe controlled using the delay register.\n\nWhen reading from the DDRAM, the IDDR element is also clocked by the system clock for the\nsame reason. The data must therefore be delayed by typically one quarter of the clock cycle so\nthat it becomes center-aligned with the system clock edges. IDELAY primitives are used for this\npurpose. DQS lines are not used for reading.\n\nODDR, IDDR and IDELAY are only supported on Virtex-4 FPGAs, but have equivalents in other\nfamilies.\n\n2.5 Bus interface\n\nThe bus interface is responsible for sending commands to the SDRAM management unit ac-\ncording to the request coming from the FML, and acknowledging bus cycles at the appropriate\ntime.\n\n3 Using the core\n\n3.1 Connecting\n\nThe differential clock going to the SDRAM chips should be generated using a dedicated FPGA\nclocking resource, such as a DCM. It is bad practice to simply add an inverter on the negative\nclock line, as the inverter will also add a delay.\n\nThis DCM can also introduce a 90 degree delay on the clock and the resulting signal be used to\ngenerate DQS by connecting it to the dqs_clk input of the HPDMC top-level.\n\nHPDMC uses IDELAY elements internally, but does not include the required IDELAYCTRL primi-\ntive. You must instantiate an IDELAYCTRL in your design, generate the 200MHz reference clock\nand connect it to the IDELAYCTRL through a BUFG. The other signals of IDELAYCTRL can be left\nunused.\n\n3.2 Programming\n\nWhen the system is powered up, HPDMC comes up in bypass mode and the SDRAM initial-\nization sequence should be performed from then, by controlling the pins at a low level using the\nbypass register.\n\nThe SDRAM must be programmed to use a fixed burst length of 8', and a CAS latency of 2\n(preferred) or 3. CAS latency 2.5 is not supported.\n\nHPDMC’s timing registers may also have to be reprogrammed to match the memory chip’s\nparameters. If a DIMM is used, it is possible to read those parameters from the serial presence\ndetect (SPD) EEPROM and program HPDMC accordingly.\n\nOnce the SDRAM is initialized and the timing registers are programmed, the controller can be\nbrought up by clearing the bypass and reset bits from the system register.\n\nYou may also need to tune the data capture delay. Reset the tap count to 0 by writing bit 0\nto the delay register, then increment the delay to the desired value by repeatedly writing bits 1\nand 2 simultaneously.\n\nThe DQS phase shift may also be adjusted. The procedure is the same, except that the delay\ncannot be reset and that the ready bit should be set when writing the enable and incrementation\nbits. The memory is now ready to be accessed over the FML interface.\n\n‘It might seem surprising that the burst length of the SDRAM and FML are not the same. This is because\nDDR SDRAM counts the words on both clock edges. Here, a burst of 8 32-bit words sent at double data rate on\nthe SDRAM side corresponds to a burst of 4 64-bit words at single data rate on the FML side.\n\nCopyright notice\n\nCopyright ©2007-2009 Sébastien Bourdeauducq.\n\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the\nGNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover\nTexts, and no Back-Cover Texts.

Monitors the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) status, ensuring stable clock signals for SDRAM operations.\nHere is the architecture information:\nThe HPDMC (High-Performance Dynamic Memory Controller) architecture is designed to manage high-bandwidth DDR SDRAM access for applications like live video processing. The architecture is modular and is divided into several interconnected components, each with specific responsibilities and functionalities, summarized as follows:\n### 1. **Control Interface**\n   - The control interface manages the operational mode, timing configurations, and initialization of the SDRAM. This interface is accessible through a dedicated CSR (Control and Status Register) bus, separate from the data bus. This separation reduces FPGA resource usage and avoids timing issues on the system bus.\n   - **Bypass Mode**: The control interface enables bypass mode, allowing the CPU to directly control the SDRAM command and address bus. This mode is specifically used during the SDRAM initialization sequence, allowing low-level control over each SDRAM pin, such as `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_we_n`, and `sdram_ras_n`. In this setup, HPDMC doesn't provide a hardware state machine for initialization, leaving the CPU responsible for this task.\n### 2. **SDRAM Management Unit**\n   - This unit acts as the core state machine of HPDMC, managing the SDRAM bus when not in bypass mode. The management unit is responsible for issuing precharge, activation, periodic refresh, and read/write commands to the SDRAM.\n   - **Timing Parameters**: The management unit retrieves critical timing parameters, including `tRP` (Row Precharge time), `tRCD` (Row to Column Delay), `tREFI` (Refresh Interval), and `tRFC` (Refresh Cycle time), from the control interface’s timing register. These parameters help ensure the SDRAM operates within required specifications.\n   - **Read/Write Protocol**: The management unit interacts with a protocol similar to Wishbone, where a strobe input indicates when a command should be processed. Upon completion, an acknowledgment signal is sent back, allowing the next command to be issued on the following clock cycle.\n### 3. **Data Path Controller**\n   - This controller is responsible for managing data flow to and from the SDRAM, specifically handling direction switching on data lines and delaying commands when necessary to avoid conflicts. It receives `read_safe`, `write_safe`, and `precharge_safe` signals from the SDRAM management unit to prevent data collisions.\n   - **DQS and Delay Management**: Data is synchronized using IDDR and ODDR primitives to meet timing requirements. When writing to the SDRAM, data is sent on both the rising and falling edges of the system clock (`sys_clk`). The DQS clock (data strobe) signal is typically delayed by 90 degrees to provide optimal timing alignment, a process managed by the delay register.\n### 4. **Data Path**\n   - This component handles data capture and output, managing bidirectional data flow to the SDRAM. It is designed to simplify timing by using a synchronized DQS phase shift, with the ability to delay data for proper alignment. When reading data, the IDELAY primitives introduce a one-quarter clock cycle delay to align data with the clock edges.\n   - **Clocking Support**: The `sys_clk` and `dqs_clk` signals drive the IDDR and ODDR primitives, while `dqs_psen`, `dqs_psincdec`, and `dqs_psdone` support phase shift adjustments in the DCM, helping maintain precise data alignment.\n### 5. **Bus Interface**\n   - The bus interface is responsible for sending commands from the Fast Memory Link (FML) bus to the SDRAM management unit. This interface manages command timing and synchronization, ensuring that SDRAM transactions adhere to the proper sequence.\n### 6. **System Register and Bypass Register**\n   - **System Register**: Configured by the CPU, the system register controls SDRAM command bus operations, such as enabling bypass mode and setting or clearing the `sdram_cke` (Clock Enable) signal.\n   - **Bypass Register**: Enables low-level control of SDRAM commands during initialization, where the CPU can directly issue commands to `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_we_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, and `sdram_cas_n`. Each command only lasts one clock cycle before returning to an inactive state.\n### 7. **Delay Register and Phase Shift Control**\n   - The delay register controls IDELAY elements, managing timing adjustments for data lines during read operations. Phase shift control is managed via `dqs_psen`, `dqs_psincdec`, and `dqs_psdone` signals, allowing fine-tuning of the DQS clock's phase to align with data capture requirements.\n### 8. **Digital Clock Manager (DCM)**\n   - The DCM provides differential clocking for SDRAM and introduces a 90-degree phase shift for the DQS clock. It is a critical element in maintaining timing integrity for high-speed operations and is monitored through the `pll_stat` signal, which provides feedback on clock stability and readiness.\n### Summary\nThe HPDMC architecture offers a flexible, high-performance memory control solution, balancing high-speed data access with precise timing control. Its modular design allows for direct CPU access during initialization and high-bandwidth operations via FML. Through careful synchronization of clocks, delay elements, and phase adjustments, the HPDMC is equipped to manage DDR SDRAM in timing-sensitive applications like live video processing, ensuring data integrity and stability across operations.",

They encapsulate key aspects of the clock's expected behavior, including logical inversion, timing relationships, jitter monitoring, and ensuring that the clock signals do not overlap. By embedding these assertions within your verification environment, you can achieve a robust and reliable check on differential signaling, thereby enhancing system stability during high-frequency operations with the SDRAM.": [
            "High Performance Dynamic Memory Controller\n\nSébastien Bourdeauducq\n\nDecember 2009\n\n1 Specifications\n\nThis controller is targeted at high bandwidth applications such as live video processing.\n\nIt is designed to drive 32-bit DDR SDRAM memory (which can be physically made up of two\n16-bit chips).\n\nThe memory contents are accessed through a 64-bit FML (Fast Memory Link) bus with a burst\nlength of 4. FML is a burst-oriented bus designed to ease the design of DRAM controllers. Its\nsignaling resembles WISHBONE, but basically removes all corner cases with burst modes to\nsave on logic resources and aspirin.\n\nHPDMC provides high flexibility and savings on hardware by implementing a bypass mode which\ngives the CPU low-level access to the SDRAM command interface (address pins, bank address\npins, and CKE, CS, WE, CAS and RAS). The SDRAM initialization sequence is assigned to the\nCPU, which should use this mode to implement it. Timing parameters are also configurable at\nruntime. These control interfaces are accessed on a 32-bit CSR bus, separate from the data bus.\nThe CSR bus is a proprietary bus designed for Milkymist that helps reduce the FPGA resource\nusage and avoid failed timing paths on the system bus.\n\nDue to the use of IDDR, ODDR and IDELAY primitives, HPDMC currently only supports the\nVirtex-4 FPGAs.\n\n2 Architecture\n\nFML CSR bus\n\nControl interface\n\nSDRAM management\nunit\n\nBypass Address &\nMUX Command Bus\n\nread_safe,\nwrite_safe, precharge_safe\n\nstb, we, adr\n\nread, write\nconcerned_bank\n\nData path controller\nBP\n\nFigure 1: Block diagram of the HPDMC architecture.\n\n2.1 Control interface\n\nThe control interface provides a register bank on a low-speed dedicated CSR bus, which is used\nto control the operating mode of the core, set timings, and initialize the SDRAM.\n\nThe interface can access directly the SDRAM address and command bus in the so-called bypass\nmode. In this mode, the memory controller is disabled and the CPU can control each pin of the\nSDRAM control bus through the bypass register.\n\nThis mode should be used at system boot-up to perform the SDRAM initialization sequence.\nHPDMC does not provide a hardware state machine that does such initialization.\n\nThe mapped registers are the following (addresses are in bytes to match the addresses seen by\nthe CPU when the CSR bus is bridged to Wishbone) :\n\n2.1.1 System register, offset 0x00\n\nBits Access | Default | Description\n\ni |Description\n0 RW Bypass mode enable. Setting this bit transfers control of the\nSDRAM command and address bus from HPDMC to the sys-\ntem CPU. This bit should be set during the SDRAM initializa-\ntion sequence and cleared during normal memory access.\n1\n\nReset. This bit should be cleared during normal operation and\nset while reconfiguring the memory subsystem.\n\n1\nRW 1\n2 RW 0 CKE control. This bit directly drives the CKE pin of the\nSDRAM and should be always set except during the first\nstage of the initialization sequence. The core does not sup-\nport SDRAM power-down modes, so clearing this bit during\nnormal operation results in undefined behaviour.\n— 0\n\n2.1.2 Bypass register, offset 0x04\n\nThe bypass register gives the system CPU low-level access to the SDRAM. It must be used\nat system power-up to initialize the SDRAM, as the controller does not provide this initializa-\ntion. Such software initialization of the SDRAM provides greater flexibility and saves valuable\nhardware resources.\n\nWriting once to this register issues one transaction to the SDRAM command bus, ie. the values\nwritten to the CS, WE, RAS and CAS bits are only taken into account for one clock cycle, and\nthen the signals go back to their default inactive state.\n\nThe values written to this register have an effect on the SDRAM only if the controller is put in\nbypass mode using the system register.\n\nDefaulk\n\nW CS control. Setting this bit activates the CS line of the\nSDRAM during the command transaction that results from\nwriting to the bypass register. As the SDRAM control bus is\nactive low, setting this bit actually puts a ’0’ logic level to the\nCS line.\n\nTW 0 WE control Game asabove.

When this register is written, the address pins change synchronously at the same time as\nthe command pins, so there is no need to pre-position the address bits before issuing a command.\nCommands like loading the mode register can therefore be performed with a single write to this\nregister.\n\n2.1.3 Timing register, offset 0x08\nThis register allows the CPU to tune the behaviour of HPDMC so that it meets SDRAM timing\nrequirements while avoiding unnecessary wait cycles.\n\nThe controller must be held in reset using the system register when the timing register is mod-\nified.\n\nBits Access | Default | Description\nNumber of clock cycles the scheduler must wait following a\nPrecharge command. Usually referred to as trp in SDRAM\ndatasheets.\n\n2 Number of clock cycles the scheduler must wait following an\nActivate command. Usually referred to as trop in SDRAM\ndatasheets.\n\n0 CAS latency : 0 = CL2, 1 = CL3. CL2.5 is not supported.\nAutorefresh period, in clock cycles. This is the time between\neach Auto Refresh command that is issued to the SDRAM,\nnot the delay between two consecutive refreshes of a particu-\nlar row. Usually referred to as trgrr in SDRAM datasheets,\nwhich is often 7.8js (64ms is an improbable value for this\nfield).\n\nNumber of clock cycles the controller must wait following\nan Auto Refresh command. Usually referred to as trrc in\nSDRAM datasheets.\n\nNumber of clock cycles the controller must wait following the\n\nlast data sent to the SDRAM during a write. Usually referred\nto as twr in SDRAM datasheets.\n\nReserved.\n\nNB. The default values are example only, and must be adapted to your particular setup.\n\n2.1.4 Delay register, offset 0x0C\n\nThis register controls the amount of delay that is introduced on the data lines when reading\nfrom memory. It directly controls the IDELAY elements that are inserted between the pins and\nthe IDDR registers.\n\nWriting once to the register toggles the IDELAY control signals once, that is to say, the signals\nwill be active for one clock cycle and then go back to their default zero state.\n\nThis register also controls the amount of phase shift that is introduced between the system clock\nand DQS (typically 90 degrees). HPDMC provides three signals, dgs_psen, dqs_psincdec and\ndqs_psdone that should be connected to the DCM used to generate the DQS clock which is\ncontrolled by this register.\n\nThe enable and incrementation bits work the same as for IDELAY. They should only be used\nwhen the ready bit (5) is set.\n\nDefault\n(oO [Ww fo | Resets delay to 0. If this bit is set, the others are ignored.\n\n1 W Increments or decrements delay by one tap (typically 78ps). If\nthe bit 2 is set at the same time this bit is written, the tap delay\nis incremented. Otherwise, it is decremented.\n\n2 W Selects between incrementation and decrementation of the input\n\nPP a eee\n\nIncrements or decrements the phase shift on DQS. If the bit 4\nis set at the same time this bit is written, the phase shift is\nincremented. Otherwise, it is decremented.

They are intended to monitor the\nlock status of the DCMs used to generate the SDRAM and DQS\nclocks.\n\n31-8 | — Reserved.\n\nThis register can be written to at any time.\n\n2.2 SDRAM management unit\n\nThe SDRAM management unit is a state machine which controls sequentially the SDRAM\naddress and command bus. Unless the core is in bypass mode, the management unit has full\ncontrol over the SDRAM bus.\n\nThis unit is responsible for precharging banks, activating rows, periodically refreshing the\nDRAM, and sending read and write commands to the SDRAM.\n\nIt has inputs connected to the control interface registers to retreive the trp, trcp, treryr and\ntreo timing values, as well as the row idle time.\n\nIt handles read and write requests through a port made up of four elements :\n\ne a strobe input\n\ne awrite enable input (which tells if the command to send to the SDRAM should be a read\nor a write)\n\ne an address input\n\ne an acknowledgement output\n\nThe protocol used on these signals is close to the one employed in Wishbone. The strobe signal\nindicates when a new command should be completed, and remains asserted (with other signals\nkept constant) until the acknowledgement signal is asserted. At the next clock cycle, a new\ncommand should be presented, or the strobe signal should be de-asserted.\n\nIn HPDMC, those signals are driven by the bus interface.\n\nThe management unit also signals the data path when it has sent a read or a write command\ninto the SDRAM. The signal is asserted exactly at the same time as the command is asserted.\n\nIt receives read_safe, write_safe and precharge_safe signals from the data path, whose\nmeanings are explained below.\n\n2.3. Data path controller\n\nThe data path controller is responsible for :\n\ne deciding the direction of the DQ and DQS pins\n\ne delaying read, write and precharge commands from the management unit that would create\nconflicts\n\nThe delaying of the commands is acheived through the use of three signals :\n\ne read_safe: when this signal is asserted, it is safe to send a Read command to the SDRAM.\nThis is used to prevent conflicts on the data bus : this signal is asserted when, taking into\naccount the CAS latency and the burst length, the resulting burst would not overlap the\ncurrently running one.\n\nwrite_safe : same thing, for the Write command.\n\nconcerned_bank[3..0] : when the management unit issues a Read or Write command,\nit must inform the data path controller about the bank which the transfer takes place in,\nusing this one-hot encoded signal.\n\ne precharge_safe[3..0] : when a bit in this signal is asserted, it is safe to precharge the\ncorresponding bank. The management unit must use this signal so as not to precharge a\nbank interrupting a read burst or causing a write-to-precharge violation.\n\nThe data path controller is also connected to the control interface, to retreive tyr and the CAS\nlatency.\n\n2.4 Data path\n\nData is captured from or sent to the SDRAM using IDDR and ODDR primitives, in order to limit\ntiming nightmares with ISE.\n\nWhen writing to the DDRAM, the ODDR primitive puts out data synchronously to the rising\nand falling edges of the system clock. This was chosen to ease timing between the FML (which\nis clocked by the system clock) and the I/O elements without introducing additional latency\ncycles. The data should therefore be strobed by DQS after a short time following each system\nclock edge. A delay corresponding to a 90 degrees phase shift gives the best margins, and can\nbe controlled using the delay register.\n\nWhen reading from the DDRAM, the IDDR element is also clocked by the system clock for the\nsame reason. The data must therefore be delayed by typically one quarter of the clock cycle so\nthat it becomes center-aligned with the system clock edges. IDELAY primitives are used for this\npurpose. DQS lines are not used for reading.\n\nODDR, IDDR and IDELAY are only supported on Virtex-4 FPGAs, but have equivalents in other\nfamilies.\n\n2.5 Bus interface\n\nThe bus interface is responsible for sending commands to the SDRAM management unit ac-\ncording to the request coming from the FML, and acknowledging bus cycles at the appropriate\ntime.\n\n3 Using the core\n\n3.1 Connecting\n\nThe differential clock going to the SDRAM chips should be generated using a dedicated FPGA\nclocking resource, such as a DCM. It is bad practice to simply add an inverter on the negative\nclock line, as the inverter will also add a delay.\n\nThis DCM can also introduce a 90 degree delay on the clock and the resulting signal be used to\ngenerate DQS by connecting it to the dqs_clk input of the HPDMC top-level.\n\nHPDMC uses IDELAY elements internally, but does not include the required IDELAYCTRL primi-\ntive. You must instantiate an IDELAYCTRL in your design, generate the 200MHz reference clock\nand connect it to the IDELAYCTRL through a BUFG. The other signals of IDELAYCTRL can be left\nunused.\n\n3.2 Programming\n\nWhen the system is powered up, HPDMC comes up in bypass mode and the SDRAM initial-\nization sequence should be performed from then, by controlling the pins at a low level using the\nbypass register.\n\nThe SDRAM must be programmed to use a fixed burst length of 8', and a CAS latency of 2\n(preferred) or 3. CAS latency 2.5 is not supported.\n\nHPDMC’s timing registers may also have to be reprogrammed to match the memory chip’s\nparameters. If a DIMM is used, it is possible to read those parameters from the serial presence\ndetect (SPD) EEPROM and program HPDMC accordingly.\n\nOnce the SDRAM is initialized and the timing registers are programmed, the controller can be\nbrought up by clearing the bypass and reset bits from the system register.\n\nYou may also need to tune the data capture delay. Reset the tap count to 0 by writing bit 0\nto the delay register, then increment the delay to the desired value by repeatedly writing bits 1\nand 2 simultaneously.\n\nThe DQS phase shift may also be adjusted. The procedure is the same, except that the delay\ncannot be reset and that the ready bit should be set when writing the enable and incrementation\nbits. The memory is now ready to be accessed over the FML interface.\n\n‘It might seem surprising that the burst length of the SDRAM and FML are not the same. This is because\nDDR SDRAM counts the words on both clock edges.

The architecture is modular and is divided into several interconnected components, each with specific responsibilities and functionalities, summarized as follows:\n### 1. **Control Interface**\n   - The control interface manages the operational mode, timing configurations, and initialization of the SDRAM. This interface is accessible through a dedicated CSR (Control and Status Register) bus, separate from the data bus. This separation reduces FPGA resource usage and avoids timing issues on the system bus.\n   - **Bypass Mode**: The control interface enables bypass mode, allowing the CPU to directly control the SDRAM command and address bus. This mode is specifically used during the SDRAM initialization sequence, allowing low-level control over each SDRAM pin, such as `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_we_n`, and `sdram_ras_n`. In this setup, HPDMC doesn't provide a hardware state machine for initialization, leaving the CPU responsible for this task.\n### 2. **SDRAM Management Unit**\n   - This unit acts as the core state machine of HPDMC, managing the SDRAM bus when not in bypass mode. The management unit is responsible for issuing precharge, activation, periodic refresh, and read/write commands to the SDRAM.\n   - **Timing Parameters**: The management unit retrieves critical timing parameters, including `tRP` (Row Precharge time), `tRCD` (Row to Column Delay), `tREFI` (Refresh Interval), and `tRFC` (Refresh Cycle time), from the control interface’s timing register. These parameters help ensure the SDRAM operates within required specifications.\n   - **Read/Write Protocol**: The management unit interacts with a protocol similar to Wishbone, where a strobe input indicates when a command should be processed. Upon completion, an acknowledgment signal is sent back, allowing the next command to be issued on the following clock cycle.\n### 3. **Data Path Controller**\n   - This controller is responsible for managing data flow to and from the SDRAM, specifically handling direction switching on data lines and delaying commands when necessary to avoid conflicts. It receives `read_safe`, `write_safe`, and `precharge_safe` signals from the SDRAM management unit to prevent data collisions.\n   - **DQS and Delay Management**: Data is synchronized using IDDR and ODDR primitives to meet timing requirements. When writing to the SDRAM, data is sent on both the rising and falling edges of the system clock (`sys_clk`). The DQS clock (data strobe) signal is typically delayed by 90 degrees to provide optimal timing alignment, a process managed by the delay register.\n### 4. **Data Path**\n   - This component handles data capture and output, managing bidirectional data flow to the SDRAM. It is designed to simplify timing by using a synchronized DQS phase shift, with the ability to delay data for proper alignment. When reading data, the IDELAY primitives introduce a one-quarter clock cycle delay to align data with the clock edges.\n   - **Clocking Support**: The `sys_clk` and `dqs_clk` signals drive the IDDR and ODDR primitives, while `dqs_psen`, `dqs_psincdec`, and `dqs_psdone` support phase shift adjustments in the DCM, helping maintain precise data alignment.\n### 5. **Bus Interface**\n   - The bus interface is responsible for sending commands from the Fast Memory Link (FML) bus to the SDRAM management unit. This interface manages command timing and synchronization, ensuring that SDRAM transactions adhere to the proper sequence.\n### 6. **System Register and Bypass Register**\n   - **System Register**: Configured by the CPU, the system register controls SDRAM command bus operations, such as enabling bypass mode and setting or clearing the `sdram_cke` (Clock Enable) signal.\n   - **Bypass Register**: Enables low-level control of SDRAM commands during initialization, where the CPU can directly issue commands to `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_we_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, and `sdram_cas_n`. Each command only lasts one clock cycle before returning to an inactive state.\n### 7. **Delay Register and Phase Shift Control**\n   - The delay register controls IDELAY elements, managing timing adjustments for data lines during read operations. Phase shift control is managed via `dqs_psen`, `dqs_psincdec`, and `dqs_psdone` signals, allowing fine-tuning of the DQS clock's phase to align with data capture requirements.\n### 8. **Digital Clock Manager (DCM)**\n   - The DCM provides differential clocking for SDRAM and introduces a 90-degree phase shift for the DQS clock. It is a critical element in maintaining timing integrity for high-speed operations and is monitored through the `pll_stat` signal, which provides feedback on clock stability and readiness.\n### Summary\nThe HPDMC architecture offers a flexible, high-performance memory control solution, balancing high-speed data access with precise timing control. Its modular design allows for direct CPU access during initialization and high-bandwidth operations via FML. Through careful synchronization of clocks, delay elements, and phase adjustments, the HPDMC is equipped to manage DDR SDRAM in timing-sensitive applications like live video processing, ensuring data integrity and stability across operations.",
            "Certainly! To provide a thorough reflection and critique of the System Verilog Assertions (SVAs) provided for `sys_clk_n`, let’s analyze each component of the answer step by step and identify potential flaws or areas for improvement. \n\n### 1. **Inversion Assertion**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nalways @(posedge sys_clk) begin\n    assert (sys_clk_n === 1'b0) else $error(\"sys_clk_n should be low when sys_clk is high\");\nend\n\nalways @(negedge sys_clk) begin\n    assert (sys_clk_n === 1'b1) else $error(\"sys_clk_n should be high when sys_clk is low\");\nend\n```\n\n**Critique:**\n- **Assertion Methodology:** The current assertion checks the inversion on `posedge` and `negedge` of `sys_clk`. This is adequate but can be enhanced by combining these checks into a single property to streamline the code and maintain consistency.\n- **Specific Edge Cases:** The assertions do not handle the cases where `sys_clk` might become high or low while `sys_clk_n` is transitioning, which could affect timing analysis. It is advisable to explicitly verify this condition within a timing window.\n- **Error Reporting:** The error messages are clear, but they should ideally include additional context (such as the current time) for easier debugging.\n\n### 2. **Timing Assertion**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty clock_relationship;\n    @ (posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) // Monitors both clock edges\n    disable iff (reset) // Considering a reset condition\n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0)); // Ensure sys_clk_n goes low after sys_clk rises\nendproperty\n\nassert property (clock_relationship) else $error(\"sys_clk_n and sys_clk timing relationship violated.\");\n```\n\n**Critique:**\n- **Invalid Temporal Logic:** The property may not accurately reflect the requirement that `sys_clk_n` should be low following `sys_clk` rising. The proper assertion should involve checking the timing of `sys_clk_n` relative to both edges of `sys_clk`.\n- **Correctness:** The comment is misleading; the property implies that both clocks should occur in sequence without asserting the need for a 180-degree phase shift. It may be better to express this relationship in a more explicit phase difference.\n- **Reset Condition Handling:** The `disable iff (reset)` clause is well-placed, but there should be additional considerations where clock signals should be stable even during reset conditions.\n\n### 3. **Jitter Monitoring**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nparameter JITTER_MAX = 1ns; // Define jitter threshold as per design requirement\nassert (abs($time - $last_posedge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX) else $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\nassert (abs($time - $last_negedge(sys_clk_n)) < JITTER_MAX) else $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk_n exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\n```\n\n**Critique:**\n- **Improper Use of `$time`**: The use of `$time` to calculate jitter is not appropriate as `$time` is global to the simulator and might not reflect the real-time differences between two clock edges. Instead, it should monitor the clock period or use a combination of time between consecutive edges directly.\n- **Missing Jitter Definition:** The definition of jitter must be clear regarding its implications on functionality. The parameters for `JITTER_MAX` should be derived from expected design constraints or specifications for clearer validity.\n- **Error Context:** Similar to previous assertions, error messages lack specific context (e.g., actual time values) to assist in quickly identifying the cause of failure.\n\n### 4. **General Structure and Clarity**\n- **Modularity**: The code can benefit from a more structured approach by grouping related properties together and providing better organization through comments or sections.\n- **Documentation**: Additional documentation or comments could improve readability and maintainability, explaining the intent behind each assertion clearly. \n\n### **Overall Feedback:**\n- **Conciseness vs. Clarity**: While the assertions capture primary behavior, there is a trade-off between conciseness and clarity. More verbose but clear definitions may be beneficial.\n- **Additional Assertions**: Consider adding assertions that specifically check for invalid conditions, such as both clocks being high or low simultaneously, which should never happen in a well-functioning differential clock system.\n- **Phase Relationship Checks**: Introduce assertions to more directly and accurately represent the phase relationship expectations. This could involve monitoring both clock edges within a defined timing window.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. Refactor the assertions to be encapsulated in properties for better modularity and clarity.\n2. Improve timing assertions to directly check the required phase relationship.\n3. Utilize time durations between clock edges instead of using `$time` for jitter monitoring.\n4. Improve error messages for better debugging context.\n\nBy making these changes, you can create a more robust and effective set of assertions for validating the behavior of `sys_clk_n` in relation to `sys_clk`.",

            "Absolutely! Let's go through a structured reasoning process, verification, and finally provide the refined System Verilog Assertions (SVAs) for the `sys_clk_n` signal.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo create effective System Verilog Assertions (SVAs) for the `sys_clk_n` signal, we need to consider the unique aspects of its operation in relation to the primary clock signal `sys_clk`.

These assertions address critical aspects such as:\n\n- **Logical Inversion**: Ensuring that `sys_clk_n` accurately represents the complementary state of `sys_clk`.\n- **Timing Relationships**: Verifying that the clocks maintain a consistent 180-degree phase relationship.\n- **Jitter Monitoring**: Assessing clock stability to retain signal integrity during high-frequency operations.\n- **No Overlap**: Ensuring that `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` do not exhibit simultaneous high states, which would indicate an error.\n- **Setup and Hold Time Assertions**: These can be adapted further based on specific data signal requirements as applicable.\n\nIncorporating these assertions into your verification environment will help ensure robust checks on the differential clocking signals, enhancing the overall reliability and performance of the system during high-frequency SDRAM operations. By implementing these SVAs, you can achieve a more stable and effective verification process for `sys_clk_n` and its counterpart `sys_clk`.": [
            "High Performance Dynamic Memory Controller\n\nSébastien Bourdeauducq\n\nDecember 2009\n\n1 Specifications\n\nThis controller is targeted at high bandwidth applications such as live video processing.\n\nIt is designed to drive 32-bit DDR SDRAM memory (which can be physically made up of two\n16-bit chips).\n\nThe memory contents are accessed through a 64-bit FML (Fast Memory Link) bus with a burst\nlength of 4. FML is a burst-oriented bus designed to ease the design of DRAM controllers. Its\nsignaling resembles WISHBONE, but basically removes all corner cases with burst modes to\nsave on logic resources and aspirin.\n\nHPDMC provides high flexibility and savings on hardware by implementing a bypass mode which\ngives the CPU low-level access to the SDRAM command interface (address pins, bank address\npins, and CKE, CS, WE, CAS and RAS). The SDRAM initialization sequence is assigned to the\nCPU, which should use this mode to implement it. Timing parameters are also configurable at\nruntime. These control interfaces are accessed on a 32-bit CSR bus, separate from the data bus.\nThe CSR bus is a proprietary bus designed for Milkymist that helps reduce the FPGA resource\nusage and avoid failed timing paths on the system bus.\n\nDue to the use of IDDR, ODDR and IDELAY primitives, HPDMC currently only supports the\nVirtex-4 FPGAs.\n\n2 Architecture\n\nFML CSR bus\n\nControl interface\n\nSDRAM management\nunit\n\nBypass Address &\nMUX Command Bus\n\nread_safe,\nwrite_safe, precharge_safe\n\nstb, we, adr\n\nread, write\nconcerned_bank\n\nData path controller\nBP\n\nFigure 1: Block diagram of the HPDMC architecture.\n\n2.1 Control interface\n\nThe control interface provides a register bank on a low-speed dedicated CSR bus, which is used\nto control the operating mode of the core, set timings, and initialize the SDRAM.\n\nThe interface can access directly the SDRAM address and command bus in the so-called bypass\nmode. In this mode, the memory controller is disabled and the CPU can control each pin of the\nSDRAM control bus through the bypass register.\n\nThis mode should be used at system boot-up to perform the SDRAM initialization sequence.\nHPDMC does not provide a hardware state machine that does such initialization.\n\nThe mapped registers are the following (addresses are in bytes to match the addresses seen by\nthe CPU when the CSR bus is bridged to Wishbone) :\n\n2.1.1 System register, offset 0x00\n\nBits Access | Default | Description\n\ni |Description\n0 RW Bypass mode enable. Setting this bit transfers control of the\nSDRAM command and address bus from HPDMC to the sys-\ntem CPU. This bit should be set during the SDRAM initializa-\ntion sequence and cleared during normal memory access.\n1\n\nReset. This bit should be cleared during normal operation and\nset while reconfiguring the memory subsystem.\n\n1\nRW 1\n2 RW 0 CKE control. This bit directly drives the CKE pin of the\nSDRAM and should be always set except during the first\nstage of the initialization sequence. The core does not sup-\nport SDRAM power-down modes, so clearing this bit during\nnormal operation results in undefined behaviour.\n— 0\n\n2.1.2 Bypass register, offset 0x04\n\nThe bypass register gives the system CPU low-level access to the SDRAM. It must be used\nat system power-up to initialize the SDRAM, as the controller does not provide this initializa-\ntion. Such software initialization of the SDRAM provides greater flexibility and saves valuable\nhardware resources.\n\nWriting once to this register issues one transaction to the SDRAM command bus, ie. the values\nwritten to the CS, WE, RAS and CAS bits are only taken into account for one clock cycle, and\nthen the signals go back to their default inactive state.\n\nThe values written to this register have an effect on the SDRAM only if the controller is put in\nbypass mode using the system register.\n\nDefaulk\n\nW CS control. Setting this bit activates the CS line of the\nSDRAM during the command transaction that results from\nwriting to the bypass register. As the SDRAM control bus is\nactive low, setting this bit actually puts a ’0’ logic level to the\nCS line.\n\nTW 0 WE control Game asabove.

When this register is written, the address pins change synchronously at the same time as\nthe command pins, so there is no need to pre-position the address bits before issuing a command.\nCommands like loading the mode register can therefore be performed with a single write to this\nregister.\n\n2.1.3 Timing register, offset 0x08\nThis register allows the CPU to tune the behaviour of HPDMC so that it meets SDRAM timing\nrequirements while avoiding unnecessary wait cycles.\n\nThe controller must be held in reset using the system register when the timing register is mod-\nified.\n\nBits Access | Default | Description\nNumber of clock cycles the scheduler must wait following a\nPrecharge command. Usually referred to as trp in SDRAM\ndatasheets.\n\n2 Number of clock cycles the scheduler must wait following an\nActivate command. Usually referred to as trop in SDRAM\ndatasheets.\n\n0 CAS latency : 0 = CL2, 1 = CL3. CL2.5 is not supported.\nAutorefresh period, in clock cycles. This is the time between\neach Auto Refresh command that is issued to the SDRAM,\nnot the delay between two consecutive refreshes of a particu-\nlar row. Usually referred to as trgrr in SDRAM datasheets,\nwhich is often 7.8js (64ms is an improbable value for this\nfield).\n\nNumber of clock cycles the controller must wait following\nan Auto Refresh command. Usually referred to as trrc in\nSDRAM datasheets.\n\nNumber of clock cycles the controller must wait following the\n\nlast data sent to the SDRAM during a write. Usually referred\nto as twr in SDRAM datasheets.\n\nReserved.\n\nNB. The default values are example only, and must be adapted to your particular setup.\n\n2.1.4 Delay register, offset 0x0C\n\nThis register controls the amount of delay that is introduced on the data lines when reading\nfrom memory. It directly controls the IDELAY elements that are inserted between the pins and\nthe IDDR registers.\n\nWriting once to the register toggles the IDELAY control signals once, that is to say, the signals\nwill be active for one clock cycle and then go back to their default zero state.\n\nThis register also controls the amount of phase shift that is introduced between the system clock\nand DQS (typically 90 degrees). HPDMC provides three signals, dgs_psen, dqs_psincdec and\ndqs_psdone that should be connected to the DCM used to generate the DQS clock which is\ncontrolled by this register.\n\nThe enable and incrementation bits work the same as for IDELAY. They should only be used\nwhen the ready bit (5) is set.\n\nDefault\n(oO [Ww fo | Resets delay to 0. If this bit is set, the others are ignored.\n\n1 W Increments or decrements delay by one tap (typically 78ps). If\nthe bit 2 is set at the same time this bit is written, the tap delay\nis incremented. Otherwise, it is decremented.\n\n2 W Selects between incrementation and decrementation of the input\n\nPP a eee\n\nIncrements or decrements the phase shift on DQS. If the bit 4\nis set at the same time this bit is written, the phase shift is\nincremented. Otherwise, it is decremented. The phase shift is\ntypically between -255 and 255 and is expressed in 1/256ths of\nthe clock period.\n\nSelects between incrementation and decrementation of the DQS\n\na a\n\nWhen this Tit is set, the DCM used to generate DQS is ready\n\nPp itis erator\n\n76 |R Retreives the values of the pll_ stat inputs of the core. These\ninputs are internally double-latched so that they can directly\naccept asynchronous signals. They are intended to monitor the\nlock status of the DCMs used to generate the SDRAM and DQS\nclocks.\n\n31-8 | — Reserved.\n\nThis register can be written to at any time.\n\n2.2 SDRAM management unit\n\nThe SDRAM management unit is a state machine which controls sequentially the SDRAM\naddress and command bus. Unless the core is in bypass mode, the management unit has full\ncontrol over the SDRAM bus.\n\nThis unit is responsible for precharging banks, activating rows, periodically refreshing the\nDRAM, and sending read and write commands to the SDRAM.\n\nIt has inputs connected to the control interface registers to retreive the trp, trcp, treryr and\ntreo timing values, as well as the row idle time.\n\nIt handles read and write requests through a port made up of four elements :\n\ne a strobe input\n\ne awrite enable input (which tells if the command to send to the SDRAM should be a read\nor a write)\n\ne an address input\n\ne an acknowledgement output\n\nThe protocol used on these signals is close to the one employed in Wishbone. The strobe signal\nindicates when a new command should be completed, and remains asserted (with other signals\nkept constant) until the acknowledgement signal is asserted. At the next clock cycle, a new\ncommand should be presented, or the strobe signal should be de-asserted.\n\nIn HPDMC, those signals are driven by the bus interface.\n\nThe management unit also signals the data path when it has sent a read or a write command\ninto the SDRAM. The signal is asserted exactly at the same time as the command is asserted.\n\nIt receives read_safe, write_safe and precharge_safe signals from the data path, whose\nmeanings are explained below.\n\n2.3. Data path controller\n\nThe data path controller is responsible for :\n\ne deciding the direction of the DQ and DQS pins\n\ne delaying read, write and precharge commands from the management unit that would create\nconflicts\n\nThe delaying of the commands is acheived through the use of three signals :\n\ne read_safe: when this signal is asserted, it is safe to send a Read command to the SDRAM.\nThis is used to prevent conflicts on the data bus : this signal is asserted when, taking into\naccount the CAS latency and the burst length, the resulting burst would not overlap the\ncurrently running one.\n\nwrite_safe : same thing, for the Write command.\n\nconcerned_bank[3..0] : when the management unit issues a Read or Write command,\nit must inform the data path controller about the bank which the transfer takes place in,\nusing this one-hot encoded signal.\n\ne precharge_safe[3..0] : when a bit in this signal is asserted, it is safe to precharge the\ncorresponding bank. The management unit must use this signal so as not to precharge a\nbank interrupting a read burst or causing a write-to-precharge violation.\n\nThe data path controller is also connected to the control interface, to retreive tyr and the CAS\nlatency.\n\n2.4 Data path\n\nData is captured from or sent to the SDRAM using IDDR and ODDR primitives, in order to limit\ntiming nightmares with ISE.\n\nWhen writing to the DDRAM, the ODDR primitive puts out data synchronously to the rising\nand falling edges of the system clock. This was chosen to ease timing between the FML (which\nis clocked by the system clock) and the I/O elements without introducing additional latency\ncycles. The data should therefore be strobed by DQS after a short time following each system\nclock edge. A delay corresponding to a 90 degrees phase shift gives the best margins, and can\nbe controlled using the delay register.\n\nWhen reading from the DDRAM, the IDDR element is also clocked by the system clock for the\nsame reason. The data must therefore be delayed by typically one quarter of the clock cycle so\nthat it becomes center-aligned with the system clock edges. IDELAY primitives are used for this\npurpose. DQS lines are not used for reading.\n\nODDR, IDDR and IDELAY are only supported on Virtex-4 FPGAs, but have equivalents in other\nfamilies.\n\n2.5 Bus interface\n\nThe bus interface is responsible for sending commands to the SDRAM management unit ac-\ncording to the request coming from the FML, and acknowledging bus cycles at the appropriate\ntime.\n\n3 Using the core\n\n3.1 Connecting\n\nThe differential clock going to the SDRAM chips should be generated using a dedicated FPGA\nclocking resource, such as a DCM. It is bad practice to simply add an inverter on the negative\nclock line, as the inverter will also add a delay.\n\nThis DCM can also introduce a 90 degree delay on the clock and the resulting signal be used to\ngenerate DQS by connecting it to the dqs_clk input of the HPDMC top-level.\n\nHPDMC uses IDELAY elements internally, but does not include the required IDELAYCTRL primi-\ntive. You must instantiate an IDELAYCTRL in your design, generate the 200MHz reference clock\nand connect it to the IDELAYCTRL through a BUFG. The other signals of IDELAYCTRL can be left\nunused.\n\n3.2 Programming\n\nWhen the system is powered up, HPDMC comes up in bypass mode and the SDRAM initial-\nization sequence should be performed from then, by controlling the pins at a low level using the\nbypass register.\n\nThe SDRAM must be programmed to use a fixed burst length of 8', and a CAS latency of 2\n(preferred) or 3. CAS latency 2.5 is not supported.\n\nHPDMC’s timing registers may also have to be reprogrammed to match the memory chip’s\nparameters. If a DIMM is used, it is possible to read those parameters from the serial presence\ndetect (SPD) EEPROM and program HPDMC accordingly.\n\nOnce the SDRAM is initialized and the timing registers are programmed, the controller can be\nbrought up by clearing the bypass and reset bits from the system register.\n\nYou may also need to tune the data capture delay. Reset the tap count to 0 by writing bit 0\nto the delay register, then increment the delay to the desired value by repeatedly writing bits 1\nand 2 simultaneously.\n\nThe DQS phase shift may also be adjusted. The procedure is the same, except that the delay\ncannot be reset and that the ready bit should be set when writing the enable and incrementation\nbits. The memory is now ready to be accessed over the FML interface.\n\n‘It might seem surprising that the burst length of the SDRAM and FML are not the same. This is because\nDDR SDRAM counts the words on both clock edges. Here, a burst of 8 32-bit words sent at double data rate on\nthe SDRAM side corresponds to a burst of 4 64-bit words at single data rate on the FML side.\n\nCopyright notice\n\nCopyright ©2007-2009 Sébastien Bourdeauducq.\n\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the\nGNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover\nTexts, and no Back-Cover Texts.

The architecture is modular and is divided into several interconnected components, each with specific responsibilities and functionalities, summarized as follows:\n### 1. **Control Interface**\n   - The control interface manages the operational mode, timing configurations, and initialization of the SDRAM. This interface is accessible through a dedicated CSR (Control and Status Register) bus, separate from the data bus. This separation reduces FPGA resource usage and avoids timing issues on the system bus.\n   - **Bypass Mode**: The control interface enables bypass mode, allowing the CPU to directly control the SDRAM command and address bus. This mode is specifically used during the SDRAM initialization sequence, allowing low-level control over each SDRAM pin, such as `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_we_n`, and `sdram_ras_n`. In this setup, HPDMC doesn't provide a hardware state machine for initialization, leaving the CPU responsible for this task.\n### 2. **SDRAM Management Unit**\n   - This unit acts as the core state machine of HPDMC, managing the SDRAM bus when not in bypass mode. The management unit is responsible for issuing precharge, activation, periodic refresh, and read/write commands to the SDRAM.\n   - **Timing Parameters**: The management unit retrieves critical timing parameters, including `tRP` (Row Precharge time), `tRCD` (Row to Column Delay), `tREFI` (Refresh Interval), and `tRFC` (Refresh Cycle time), from the control interface’s timing register. These parameters help ensure the SDRAM operates within required specifications.\n   - **Read/Write Protocol**: The management unit interacts with a protocol similar to Wishbone, where a strobe input indicates when a command should be processed. Upon completion, an acknowledgment signal is sent back, allowing the next command to be issued on the following clock cycle.\n### 3. **Data Path Controller**\n   - This controller is responsible for managing data flow to and from the SDRAM, specifically handling direction switching on data lines and delaying commands when necessary to avoid conflicts. It receives `read_safe`, `write_safe`, and `precharge_safe` signals from the SDRAM management unit to prevent data collisions.\n   - **DQS and Delay Management**: Data is synchronized using IDDR and ODDR primitives to meet timing requirements. When writing to the SDRAM, data is sent on both the rising and falling edges of the system clock (`sys_clk`). The DQS clock (data strobe) signal is typically delayed by 90 degrees to provide optimal timing alignment, a process managed by the delay register.\n### 4. **Data Path**\n   - This component handles data capture and output, managing bidirectional data flow to the SDRAM. It is designed to simplify timing by using a synchronized DQS phase shift, with the ability to delay data for proper alignment. When reading data, the IDELAY primitives introduce a one-quarter clock cycle delay to align data with the clock edges.\n   - **Clocking Support**: The `sys_clk` and `dqs_clk` signals drive the IDDR and ODDR primitives, while `dqs_psen`, `dqs_psincdec`, and `dqs_psdone` support phase shift adjustments in the DCM, helping maintain precise data alignment.\n### 5. **Bus Interface**\n   - The bus interface is responsible for sending commands from the Fast Memory Link (FML) bus to the SDRAM management unit. This interface manages command timing and synchronization, ensuring that SDRAM transactions adhere to the proper sequence.\n### 6. **System Register and Bypass Register**\n   - **System Register**: Configured by the CPU, the system register controls SDRAM command bus operations, such as enabling bypass mode and setting or clearing the `sdram_cke` (Clock Enable) signal.\n   - **Bypass Register**: Enables low-level control of SDRAM commands during initialization, where the CPU can directly issue commands to `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_we_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, and `sdram_cas_n`. Each command only lasts one clock cycle before returning to an inactive state.\n### 7. **Delay Register and Phase Shift Control**\n   - The delay register controls IDELAY elements, managing timing adjustments for data lines during read operations. Phase shift control is managed via `dqs_psen`, `dqs_psincdec`, and `dqs_psdone` signals, allowing fine-tuning of the DQS clock's phase to align with data capture requirements.\n### 8. **Digital Clock Manager (DCM)**\n   - The DCM provides differential clocking for SDRAM and introduces a 90-degree phase shift for the DQS clock. It is a critical element in maintaining timing integrity for high-speed operations and is monitored through the `pll_stat` signal, which provides feedback on clock stability and readiness.\n### Summary\nThe HPDMC architecture offers a flexible, high-performance memory control solution, balancing high-speed data access with precise timing control. Its modular design allows for direct CPU access during initialization and high-bandwidth operations via FML. Through careful synchronization of clocks, delay elements, and phase adjustments, the HPDMC is equipped to manage DDR SDRAM in timing-sensitive applications like live video processing, ensuring data integrity and stability across operations.",
            "Certainly! Let’s analytically critique the proposed System Verilog Assertions (SVAs) for `sys_clk_n` from multiple angles, highlighting potential flaws or weaknesses and suggesting improvements step by step.\n\n### 1. **Inversion Verification**\n```systemverilog\nproperty inversion_check;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) \n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b0)) && \n    (sys_clk === 1'b0 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b1));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (inversion_check) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk_n should be the logical inverse of sys_clk.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Timing Sensitivity**: The assertion checks `sys_clk_n` only at the posedge of `sys_clk` or negedge of `sys_clk_n`. Ideally, this must strictly assert at the transitions of both clocks. It would be more comprehensive to check this for each edge.\n- **Redundant Checks**: The `sys_clk_n` check is triggered by both `posedge sys_clk` and `negedge sys_clk_n`, which might not cover all possible transition scenarios. Consider introducing separate assertions for each clock edge opportunistically to better catch logical or timing violations.\n- **Error Reporting**: The error message could be more descriptive, indicating exactly which condition failed, thus aiding debugging.\n\n### 2. **Timing Property**\n```systemverilog\nproperty clock_timing_relationship;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (clock_timing_relationship) else \n    $error(\"Timing relationship between sys_clk and sys_clk_n is violated.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Phase Relationships**: The assertion aims to check timing but may not fully validate the expected phase relationship because it only checks one transition's alignment. Additional assertions can be introduced to guarantee the timing across multiple cycles.\n- **Clarity**: Using `##1` indicates a one-time-step delay, which may raise questions about what guarantees are there that the two clocks maintain their relationship through subsequent cycles. \n\n### 3. **Jitter Monitoring**\n```systemverilog\nproperty jitter_monitor;\n    @(posedge sys_clk) \n    disable iff (reset) \n    (sys_clk -> ##1 (sys_clk_n[1:0] != sys_clk_n[1:0])) |-> \n    (abs($time - $last_posedge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX) &&\n    (abs($time - $last_negedge(sys_clk_n)) < JITTER_MAX);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (jitter_monitor) else \n    $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk or sys_clk_n exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Complexity**: The condition `(sys_clk_n[1:0] != sys_clk_n[1:0])` doesn't seem to effectively capture jitter analysis; it actually compares the two bits against themselves and adds no real value. Instead, consider tracking time intervals between edges.\n- **Jitter Definition**: Jitter is typically defined in terms of multiple clock cycles. Ensure that the definition aligns with industry metrics (e.g., asserting that the period of `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` is stable within a defined tolerance over a series of cycles).\n\n### 4. **No Overlap Assertion**\n```systemverilog\nproperty no_overlap;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    !(sys_clk && sys_clk_n);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (no_overlap) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk and sys_clk_n should never be high at the same time.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Signal Abstraction**: The focus on only the clock edges neglects to capture other scenarios that could lead to overlap, such as glitches or latch-up conditions. It may be beneficial to strengthen this assertion by checking for conditions over multiple clock cycles (e.g., checking over a window of ±1 clock cycle).\n- **Error Message**: As with previous assertions, enhancing error reporting clarity would help identify which specific transition caused the overlap.\n\n### 5. **General Improvements**\n- **Reset Conditions**: It’s good practice to include conditions ensuring the assertions have no false positives during reset states, but clarity on reset conditions could be improved by explicitly detailing them in each assertion.\n- **Assertions Structure and Modularity**: Grouping assertions regarding `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` can help keep the code organized, making it easier to maintain and validate the overall functionality.\n\n### **Revised SVA Suggestions**\nBased on the critiques, an improved version of the SVAs can be organized as follows:\n\n```systemverilog\n// Ensure sys_clk_n is the logical inverse of sys_clk on their respective edges\nproperty inversion_check;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) \n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b0)) and\n    (sys_clk === 1'b0 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b1));\nendproperty\nassert property (inversion_check) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk_n should be the logical inverse of sys_clk at each edge.\");\n\n// Ensure clocks maintain their phase relationship across multiple cycles\nproperty clock_phase_relationship;\n    @(posedge sys_clk)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0));\nendproperty\nassert property (clock_phase_relationship) else \n    $error(\"Phase relationship between sys_clk and sys_clk_n is violated.\");\n\n// Monitor jitter stability for both clocks\n// This can be more meaningful if we define intervals and check stability\nproperty jitter_stability;\n    @(posedge sys_clk) \n    disable iff (reset) \n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (abs($time - $last_edge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX));\nendproperty\nassert property (jitter_stability) else \n    $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk exceeds the maximum allowed value.\");\n\n// Ensure sys_clk and sys_clk_n never overlap\nproperty no_overlap;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    !(sys_clk && sys_clk_n);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_overlap) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk and sys_clk_n should never be high at the same time.\");\n```\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe revised assertions aim to address specific weaknesses identified in the original proposal. The improvements focus on clarity, comprehensiveness, and ensuring robust verification of the `sys_clk_n` signal in relation to `sys_clk`. The assertion structure has been made modular, facilitating easier debugging and understanding of the clock signal's expected behavior.",
            "Generate SVAs for sys_clk_n. Here is more information about the signal: Here's the extracted information on the `sys_clk_n` (Complementary System Clock Signal) based on the provided design specification:\n**[Signal name]:** sys_clk_n\n**[Description]:**\n  - **[Definition]:** Complementary (inverted) system clock used alongside `sys_clk` to support differential clocking for the SDRAM.\n  - **[Functionality]:**\n    - The complementary clock `sys_clk_n` works with `sys_clk` to provide a stable differential clock to the SDRAM chips.\n    - This differential clocking is designed to reduce noise and improve timing accuracy, essential for high-frequency memory operations.\n    - It is crucial that the differential clock is generated by a dedicated FPGA clocking resource, such as a Digital Clock Manager (DCM), to ensure low latency and minimal jitter.\n  - **[Interconnection]:**\n    - `sys_clk_n` should not be implemented with a simple inverter on the `sys_clk` line, as this would introduce unwanted delays, degrading signal integrity. The DCM manages both `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` to maintain accurate phase alignment.\n    - Works in conjunction with the DQS phase adjustment, which is configured through specific delay settings, optimizing read and write cycles.\n  - **[Additional information]:**\n    - If additional timing control is needed, IDELAYCTRL can be used to adjust the delay on data lines, indirectly affecting the effective timing of `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n`.\n**[Related Signals]:** sys_clk, DQS, IDELAY, DCM.\nPlease refine your old answer: Absolutely! Let's go through a structured reasoning process, verification, and finally provide the refined System Verilog Assertions (SVAs) for the `sys_clk_n` signal.\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nTo create effective System Verilog Assertions (SVAs) for the `sys_clk_n` signal, we need to consider the unique aspects of its operation in relation to the primary clock signal `sys_clk`. Here are the key considerations:\n\n1. **Inversion Verification**: Since `sys_clk_n` is designed to be the complementary (inverted) version of `sys_clk`, we need assertions that check this logical relationship during clock transitions.\n\n2. **Duty Cycle and Phase Alignment**: To ensure proper differential signaling, it's critical that both `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` maintain similar duty cycles and a consistent 180-degree phase relationship.\n\n3. **Timing Validations**: Assert that the timing between the rising and falling edges of these clocks adheres to the necessary timing requirements to prevent signal integrity issues.\n\n4. **Jitter Monitoring**: Due to high-frequency operation, ensuring that both clocks exhibit minimal jitter is crucial. Therefore, assertions should monitor the stability of edges to detect any excessive jitter.\n\n5. **Setup and Hold Times**: Additional properties can assert that the setup and hold times for signals around these clock edges meet the specifications.\n\n### [Verification]\nThe following System Verilog Assertions are proposed to validate the behavior of `sys_clk_n`:\n\n```systemverilog\n// Assertion to check that sys_clk_n is the logical inversion of sys_clk\nproperty inversion_check;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) \n    disable iff (reset) // Ensure assertions are disabled during reset\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b0)) && \n    (sys_clk === 1'b0 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b1));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (inversion_check) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk_n should be the logical inverse of sys_clk.\");\n\n// Timing property to ensure both clocks have a defined timing relationship\nproperty clock_timing_relationship;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (clock_timing_relationship) else \n    $error(\"Timing relationship between sys_clk and sys_clk_n is violated.\");\n\n// Additional check for jitter limits\nparameter JITTER_MAX = 1ns; // Define a jitter threshold\nproperty jitter_monitor;\n    @(posedge sys_clk) \n    disable iff (reset) \n    (sys_clk -> ##1 (sys_clk_n[1:0] != sys_clk_n[1:0])) |-> \n    (abs($time - $last_posedge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX) &&\n    (abs($time - $last_negedge(sys_clk_n)) < JITTER_MAX);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (jitter_monitor) else \n    $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk or sys_clk_n exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\n\n// Assertion to ensure that both clocks never exceed their high/low states simultaneously\nproperty no_overlap;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    !(sys_clk && sys_clk_n);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (no_overlap) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk and sys_clk_n should never be high at the same time.\");\n```\n\n### [Answer]\nThese System Verilog Assertions are designed to monitor and validate the performance and integrity of the `sys_clk_n` signal in relation to `sys_clk`. They encapsulate key aspects of the clock's expected behavior, including logical inversion, timing relationships, jitter monitoring, and ensuring that the clock signals do not overlap. By embedding these assertions within your verification environment, you can achieve a robust and reliable check on differential signaling, thereby enhancing system stability during high-frequency operations with the SDRAM..\n\nAccording to the Feedback: Certainly! Let’s analytically critique the proposed System Verilog Assertions (SVAs) for `sys_clk_n` from multiple angles, highlighting potential flaws or weaknesses and suggesting improvements step by step.\n\n### 1. **Inversion Verification**\n```systemverilog\nproperty inversion_check;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) \n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b0)) && \n    (sys_clk === 1'b0 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b1));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (inversion_check) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk_n should be the logical inverse of sys_clk.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Timing Sensitivity**: The assertion checks `sys_clk_n` only at the posedge of `sys_clk` or negedge of `sys_clk_n`. Ideally, this must strictly assert at the transitions of both clocks. It would be more comprehensive to check this for each edge.\n- **Redundant Checks**: The `sys_clk_n` check is triggered by both `posedge sys_clk` and `negedge sys_clk_n`, which might not cover all possible transition scenarios. Consider introducing separate assertions for each clock edge opportunistically to better catch logical or timing violations.\n- **Error Reporting**: The error message could be more descriptive, indicating exactly which condition failed, thus aiding debugging.\n\n### 2. **Timing Property**\n```systemverilog\nproperty clock_timing_relationship;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (clock_timing_relationship) else \n    $error(\"Timing relationship between sys_clk and sys_clk_n is violated.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Phase Relationships**: The assertion aims to check timing but may not fully validate the expected phase relationship because it only checks one transition's alignment. Additional assertions can be introduced to guarantee the timing across multiple cycles.\n- **Clarity**: Using `##1` indicates a one-time-step delay, which may raise questions about what guarantees are there that the two clocks maintain their relationship through subsequent cycles. \n\n### 3. **Jitter Monitoring**\n```systemverilog\nproperty jitter_monitor;\n    @(posedge sys_clk) \n    disable iff (reset) \n    (sys_clk -> ##1 (sys_clk_n[1:0] != sys_clk_n[1:0])) |-> \n    (abs($time - $last_posedge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX) &&\n    (abs($time - $last_negedge(sys_clk_n)) < JITTER_MAX);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (jitter_monitor) else \n    $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk or sys_clk_n exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Complexity**: The condition `(sys_clk_n[1:0] != sys_clk_n[1:0])` doesn't seem to effectively capture jitter analysis; it actually compares the two bits against themselves and adds no real value. Instead, consider tracking time intervals between edges.\n- **Jitter Definition**: Jitter is typically defined in terms of multiple clock cycles. Ensure that the definition aligns with industry metrics (e.g., asserting that the period of `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` is stable within a defined tolerance over a series of cycles).\n\n### 4. **No Overlap Assertion**\n```systemverilog\nproperty no_overlap;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    !(sys_clk && sys_clk_n);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (no_overlap) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk and sys_clk_n should never be high at the same time.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Signal Abstraction**: The focus on only the clock edges neglects to capture other scenarios that could lead to overlap, such as glitches or latch-up conditions. It may be beneficial to strengthen this assertion by checking for conditions over multiple clock cycles (e.g., checking over a window of ±1 clock cycle).\n- **Error Message**: As with previous assertions, enhancing error reporting clarity would help identify which specific transition caused the overlap.\n\n### 5. **General Improvements**\n- **Reset Conditions**: It’s good practice to include conditions ensuring the assertions have no false positives during reset states, but clarity on reset conditions could be improved by explicitly detailing them in each assertion.\n- **Assertions Structure and Modularity**: Grouping assertions regarding `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` can help keep the code organized, making it easier to maintain and validate the overall functionality.\n\n### **Revised SVA Suggestions**\nBased on the critiques, an improved version of the SVAs can be organized as follows:\n\n```systemverilog\n// Ensure sys_clk_n is the logical inverse of sys_clk on their respective edges\nproperty inversion_check;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) \n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b0)) and\n    (sys_clk === 1'b0 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b1));\nendproperty\nassert property (inversion_check) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk_n should be the logical inverse of sys_clk at each edge.\");\n\n// Ensure clocks maintain their phase relationship across multiple cycles\nproperty clock_phase_relationship;\n    @(posedge sys_clk)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0));\nendproperty\nassert property (clock_phase_relationship) else \n    $error(\"Phase relationship between sys_clk and sys_clk_n is violated.\");\n\n// Monitor jitter stability for both clocks\n// This can be more meaningful if we define intervals and check stability\nproperty jitter_stability;\n    @(posedge sys_clk) \n    disable iff (reset) \n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (abs($time - $last_edge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX));\nendproperty\nassert property (jitter_stability) else \n    $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk exceeds the maximum allowed value.\");\n\n// Ensure sys_clk and sys_clk_n never overlap\nproperty no_overlap;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    !(sys_clk && sys_clk_n);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_overlap) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk and sys_clk_n should never be high at the same time.\");\n```\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe revised assertions aim to address specific weaknesses identified in the original proposal.

        "[Reasoning Process]  \nTo generate System Verilog Assertions (SVAs) for the complementary clock signal `sys_clk_n`, we need to consider its timing relationships with the primary clock signal `sys_clk` and ensure it meets the requirements for stable differential clocking. Given that `sys_clk_n` is an inverted clock signal, our assertions will need to verify that it behaves as expected in relation to `sys_clk`. \n\nKey aspects to consider for `sys_clk_n` include:\n1. **Inversion Timing**: `sys_clk_n` should be the logical inversion of `sys_clk`, which means that when `sys_clk` is at a high level, `sys_clk_n` should be low, and vice versa.\n2. **Duty Cycle**: Both clocks should maintain a similar duty cycle to ensure effective operations in differential signaling.\n3. **Phase Relationship**: The two clock signals should be phase-aligned with an expected shift of 180 degrees to maintain the differential clock integrity.\n4. **Clock Stability**: Every clock edge should exhibit stable behavior with minimal jitter to avoid timing violations during memory operations.\n\nWe will create assertions based on these considerations to monitor the behavior of `sys_clk_n`.\n\n[Verification]  \nThe following assertions will be defined for `sys_clk_n`:\n1. **Inversion Assertion**: Check that `sys_clk_n` is always the logical inverse of `sys_clk`.\n2. **Timing Assertions**: Ensure that the edges of the clocks maintain the required timing relationships to avoid ambiguity in clock sampling.\n3. **Jitter Monitoring**: Assert that the timing between edges of the `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` are within specified limits to ensure stability.\n\n[Answer]  \nHere are the System Verilog Assertions for `sys_clk_n`:\n\n```systemverilog\n// Assertion to check that sys_clk_n is the logical inversion of sys_clk\nalways @(posedge sys_clk) begin\n    assert (sys_clk_n === 1'b0) else $error(\"sys_clk_n should be low when sys_clk is high\");\nend\n\nalways @(negedge sys_clk) begin\n    assert (sys_clk_n === 1'b1) else $error(\"sys_clk_n should be high when sys_clk is low\");\nend\n\n// Timing Assertion to ensure both clocks have a defined time relationship\n// Assuming required setup and hold times\nproperty clock_relationship;\n    @ (posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) // Monitors both clock edges\n    disable iff (reset) // Considering a reset condition\n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0)); // Ensure sys_clk_n goes low after sys_clk rises\nendproperty\n\nassert property (clock_relationship) else $error(\"sys_clk_n and sys_clk timing relationship violated.\");\n\n// Additional check for clock stability within required jitter limits\n// Example: Define max jitter as `JITTER_MAX` time units\nparameter JITTER_MAX = 1ns; // Define jitter threshold as per design requirement\nassert (abs($time - $last_posedge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX) else $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\nassert (abs($time - $last_negedge(sys_clk_n)) < JITTER_MAX) else $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk_n exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\n```\n\nThese assertions can be placed within a testbench or a dedicated formal verification module to continuously validate the integrity and performance of the `sys_clk_n` signal in relation to `sys_clk`.": [

                "Certainly! To provide a thorough reflection and critique of the System Verilog Assertions (SVAs) provided for `sys_clk_n`, let’s analyze each component of the answer step by step and identify potential flaws or areas for improvement. \n\n### 1. **Inversion Assertion**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nalways @(posedge sys_clk) begin\n    assert (sys_clk_n === 1'b0) else $error(\"sys_clk_n should be low when sys_clk is high\");\nend\n\nalways @(negedge sys_clk) begin\n    assert (sys_clk_n === 1'b1) else $error(\"sys_clk_n should be high when sys_clk is low\");\nend\n```\n\n**Critique:**\n- **Assertion Methodology:** The current assertion checks the inversion on `posedge` and `negedge` of `sys_clk`. This is adequate but can be enhanced by combining these checks into a single property to streamline the code and maintain consistency.\n- **Specific Edge Cases:** The assertions do not handle the cases where `sys_clk` might become high or low while `sys_clk_n` is transitioning, which could affect timing analysis. It is advisable to explicitly verify this condition within a timing window.\n- **Error Reporting:** The error messages are clear, but they should ideally include additional context (such as the current time) for easier debugging.\n\n### 2. **Timing Assertion**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty clock_relationship;\n    @ (posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) // Monitors both clock edges\n    disable iff (reset) // Considering a reset condition\n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0)); // Ensure sys_clk_n goes low after sys_clk rises\nendproperty\n\nassert property (clock_relationship) else $error(\"sys_clk_n and sys_clk timing relationship violated.\");\n```\n\n**Critique:**\n- **Invalid Temporal Logic:** The property may not accurately reflect the requirement that `sys_clk_n` should be low following `sys_clk` rising. The proper assertion should involve checking the timing of `sys_clk_n` relative to both edges of `sys_clk`.\n- **Correctness:** The comment is misleading; the property implies that both clocks should occur in sequence without asserting the need for a 180-degree phase shift. It may be better to express this relationship in a more explicit phase difference.\n- **Reset Condition Handling:** The `disable iff (reset)` clause is well-placed, but there should be additional considerations where clock signals should be stable even during reset conditions.\n\n### 3. **Jitter Monitoring**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nparameter JITTER_MAX = 1ns; // Define jitter threshold as per design requirement\nassert (abs($time - $last_posedge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX) else $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\nassert (abs($time - $last_negedge(sys_clk_n)) < JITTER_MAX) else $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk_n exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\n```\n\n**Critique:**\n- **Improper Use of `$time`**: The use of `$time` to calculate jitter is not appropriate as `$time` is global to the simulator and might not reflect the real-time differences between two clock edges. Instead, it should monitor the clock period or use a combination of time between consecutive edges directly.\n- **Missing Jitter Definition:** The definition of jitter must be clear regarding its implications on functionality. The parameters for `JITTER_MAX` should be derived from expected design constraints or specifications for clearer validity.\n- **Error Context:** Similar to previous assertions, error messages lack specific context (e.g., actual time values) to assist in quickly identifying the cause of failure.\n\n### 4. **General Structure and Clarity**\n- **Modularity**: The code can benefit from a more structured approach by grouping related properties together and providing better organization through comments or sections.\n- **Documentation**: Additional documentation or comments could improve readability and maintainability, explaining the intent behind each assertion clearly. \n\n### **Overall Feedback:**\n- **Conciseness vs. Clarity**: While the assertions capture primary behavior, there is a trade-off between conciseness and clarity. More verbose but clear definitions may be beneficial.\n- **Additional Assertions**: Consider adding assertions that specifically check for invalid conditions, such as both clocks being high or low simultaneously, which should never happen in a well-functioning differential clock system.\n- **Phase Relationship Checks**: Introduce assertions to more directly and accurately represent the phase relationship expectations. This could involve monitoring both clock edges within a defined timing window.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n1. Refactor the assertions to be encapsulated in properties for better modularity and clarity.\n2. Improve timing assertions to directly check the required phase relationship.\n3.

                "Certainly! Let’s analytically critique the proposed System Verilog Assertions (SVAs) for `sys_clk_n` from multiple angles, highlighting potential flaws or weaknesses and suggesting improvements step by step.\n\n### 1. **Inversion Verification**\n```systemverilog\nproperty inversion_check;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) \n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b0)) && \n    (sys_clk === 1'b0 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b1));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (inversion_check) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk_n should be the logical inverse of sys_clk.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Timing Sensitivity**: The assertion checks `sys_clk_n` only at the posedge of `sys_clk` or negedge of `sys_clk_n`. Ideally, this must strictly assert at the transitions of both clocks. It would be more comprehensive to check this for each edge.\n- **Redundant Checks**: The `sys_clk_n` check is triggered by both `posedge sys_clk` and `negedge sys_clk_n`, which might not cover all possible transition scenarios. Consider introducing separate assertions for each clock edge opportunistically to better catch logical or timing violations.\n- **Error Reporting**: The error message could be more descriptive, indicating exactly which condition failed, thus aiding debugging.\n\n### 2. **Timing Property**\n```systemverilog\nproperty clock_timing_relationship;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0));\nendproperty\n\nassert property (clock_timing_relationship) else \n    $error(\"Timing relationship between sys_clk and sys_clk_n is violated.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Phase Relationships**: The assertion aims to check timing but may not fully validate the expected phase relationship because it only checks one transition's alignment. Additional assertions can be introduced to guarantee the timing across multiple cycles.\n- **Clarity**: Using `##1` indicates a one-time-step delay, which may raise questions about what guarantees are there that the two clocks maintain their relationship through subsequent cycles. \n\n### 3. **Jitter Monitoring**\n```systemverilog\nproperty jitter_monitor;\n    @(posedge sys_clk) \n    disable iff (reset) \n    (sys_clk -> ##1 (sys_clk_n[1:0] != sys_clk_n[1:0])) |-> \n    (abs($time - $last_posedge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX) &&\n    (abs($time - $last_negedge(sys_clk_n)) < JITTER_MAX);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (jitter_monitor) else \n    $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk or sys_clk_n exceeds maximum allowed value.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Complexity**: The condition `(sys_clk_n[1:0] != sys_clk_n[1:0])` doesn't seem to effectively capture jitter analysis; it actually compares the two bits against themselves and adds no real value. Instead, consider tracking time intervals between edges.\n- **Jitter Definition**: Jitter is typically defined in terms of multiple clock cycles. Ensure that the definition aligns with industry metrics (e.g., asserting that the period of `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` is stable within a defined tolerance over a series of cycles).\n\n### 4. **No Overlap Assertion**\n```systemverilog\nproperty no_overlap;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    !(sys_clk && sys_clk_n);\nendproperty\n\nassert property (no_overlap) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk and sys_clk_n should never be high at the same time.\");\n```\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\n- **Signal Abstraction**: The focus on only the clock edges neglects to capture other scenarios that could lead to overlap, such as glitches or latch-up conditions. It may be beneficial to strengthen this assertion by checking for conditions over multiple clock cycles (e.g., checking over a window of ±1 clock cycle).\n- **Error Message**: As with previous assertions, enhancing error reporting clarity would help identify which specific transition caused the overlap.\n\n### 5. **General Improvements**\n- **Reset Conditions**: It’s good practice to include conditions ensuring the assertions have no false positives during reset states, but clarity on reset conditions could be improved by explicitly detailing them in each assertion.\n- **Assertions Structure and Modularity**: Grouping assertions regarding `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` can help keep the code organized, making it easier to maintain and validate the overall functionality.\n\n### **Revised SVA Suggestions**\nBased on the critiques, an improved version of the SVAs can be organized as follows:\n\n```systemverilog\n// Ensure sys_clk_n is the logical inverse of sys_clk on their respective edges\nproperty inversion_check;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n) \n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b0)) and\n    (sys_clk === 1'b0 |-> (sys_clk_n === 1'b1));\nendproperty\nassert property (inversion_check) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk_n should be the logical inverse of sys_clk at each edge.\");\n\n// Ensure clocks maintain their phase relationship across multiple cycles\nproperty clock_phase_relationship;\n    @(posedge sys_clk)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    (sys_clk === 1'b1 |-> (sys_clk_n ##1 sys_clk == 1'b0));\nendproperty\nassert property (clock_phase_relationship) else \n    $error(\"Phase relationship between sys_clk and sys_clk_n is violated.\");\n\n// Monitor jitter stability for both clocks\n// This can be more meaningful if we define intervals and check stability\nproperty jitter_stability;\n    @(posedge sys_clk) \n    disable iff (reset) \n    (sys_clk == 1'b1 |-> (abs($time - $last_edge(sys_clk)) < JITTER_MAX));\nendproperty\nassert property (jitter_stability) else \n    $error(\"Jitter on sys_clk exceeds the maximum allowed value.\");\n\n// Ensure sys_clk and sys_clk_n never overlap\nproperty no_overlap;\n    @(posedge sys_clk or negedge sys_clk_n)\n    disable iff (reset)\n    !(sys_clk && sys_clk_n);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_overlap) else \n    $error(\"sys_clk and sys_clk_n should never be high at the same time.\");\n```\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe revised assertions aim to address specific weaknesses identified in the original proposal. The improvements focus on clarity, comprehensiveness, and ensuring robust verification of the `sys_clk_n` signal in relation to `sys_clk`. The assertion structure has been made modular, facilitating easier debugging and understanding of the clock signal's expected behavior.",

These assertions address critical aspects such as:\n\n- **Logical Inversion**: Ensuring that `sys_clk_n` accurately represents the complementary state of `sys_clk`.\n- **Timing Relationships**: Verifying that the clocks maintain a consistent 180-degree phase relationship.\n- **Jitter Monitoring**: Assessing clock stability to retain signal integrity during high-frequency operations.\n- **No Overlap**: Ensuring that `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` do not exhibit simultaneous high states, which would indicate an error.\n- **Setup and Hold Time Assertions**: These can be adapted further based on specific data signal requirements as applicable.\n\nIncorporating these assertions into your verification environment will help ensure robust checks on the differential clocking signals, enhancing the overall reliability and performance of the system during high-frequency SDRAM operations.

These assertions address critical aspects such as:\n\n- **Logical Inversion**: Ensuring that `sys_clk_n` accurately represents the complementary state of `sys_clk`.\n- **Timing Relationships**: Verifying that the clocks maintain a consistent 180-degree phase relationship.\n- **Jitter Monitoring**: Assessing clock stability to retain signal integrity during high-frequency operations.\n- **No Overlap**: Ensuring that `sys_clk` and `sys_clk_n` do not exhibit simultaneous high states, which would indicate an error.\n- **Setup and Hold Time Assertions**: These can be adapted further based on specific data signal requirements as applicable.\n\nIncorporating these assertions into your verification environment will help ensure robust checks on the differential clocking signals, enhancing the overall reliability and performance of the system during high-frequency SDRAM operations.
