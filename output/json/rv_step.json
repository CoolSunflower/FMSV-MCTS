        "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle generating SVAs for the 'step' signal. First, I need to recall the requirements. The user wants assertions that cover width, connectivity, and functionality. Also, they mentioned not to create new signals and stick strictly to the given spec.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. The spec says 'step' is 8-bit. So, I need an assertion that checks the width of 'step' using $bits. That's straightforward: assert that $bits(step) == 8. But wait, in Verilog, the signal might be declared as a reg or wire with a specific width. But the SVA just needs to check the bit width. So the width assertion is covered here.\n\nNext, connectivity. The 'step' is connected to the tick generator and affects mtime. The description says when a tick occurs, mtime increments by step. So connectivity-wise, I need to check that when there's a tick, the next mtime (mtime_d) is current mtime plus step. But wait, the workflow mentions that when a tick is received, the mux selects either step or zero. Wait, the workflow says: \"When a tick is received, a multiplexer selects either the step value or zero.\" Hmm, so maybe the step is added only when there's a tick. So the connectivity here is that when tick is high, mtime_d should be mtime + step. But how is the mux controlled? The description says the mux selects step or zero. So perhaps when tick is active, step is added; otherwise, no increment. So the connectivity assertion would check that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. But the user provided 'tick' as an output. Wait, in the signal list, 'tick' is an output. So the assertion would be: when tick is high, then mtime_d should be mtime + step. But also, when tick is low, mtime_d should remain the same. Wait, but the workflow says the mux selects step or zero. Wait, maybe the adder adds either step or zero. So mtime_d = mtime + (tick ? step : 0). So the connectivity assertion would check that whenever there's a tick, the next mtime is incremented by step. So the property would be: if tick is high, then mtime_d == mtime + step. But how to capture that in SVA? Since mtime_d is the next value, perhaps using a property that checks that at the posedge of clk_i, if tick is high, then mtime_d should be mtime + step. But wait, the tick is generated by the tick generator, which is based on the prescaler. So the tick is an output that pulses when the prescaler counter hits the value. So when tick is high, the step is added. So the connectivity assertion would be that when tick is high, the mtime_d is correctly incremented by step. That's one connectivity check.\n\nAnother connectivity aspect: step is connected to the tick generator. But the tick generator's main function is to generate the tick based on the prescaler. The step is used in the mtime increment, not directly in the tick generation. So maybe the connectivity here is between step and mtime_d via the tick. So the main connectivity is that step affects mtime_d when tick is active.\n\nFor functionality, the step should be an 8-bit value, and when the tick occurs, mtime increments by step. Also, the step should not be zero unless intended, but the spec allows firmware to set it. However, the spec says step is 8-bit, so possible values are 0 to 255. But the functionality assertion would check that whenever a tick occurs, the mtime increments by step. Wait, that's similar to the connectivity check. Maybe the functionality is covered in that assertion. But perhaps there's more. For example, when the module is not active, step might not affect mtime. But the spec says the module assumes the clock is always on, and active is a module active signal. So when active is low, maybe the module is disabled. So the functionality assertion should consider the active signal. Wait, the 'active' signal is an input that activates the module. So when active is low, the module might not function. So the increment should only happen when active is high. So the assertion should check that when active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d is mtime + step. If active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d should not change. But the spec says \"the timer doesnâ€™t consider low-power modes and assumes the clock is neither turned off nor changed during runtime.\" Hmm, but the 'active' signal is part of the inputs. So maybe when active is low, the module is inactive, so the mtime doesn't increment. So the functionality assertion should include the active signal. So the property would be: if active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d is mtime + step. If active is low, even with tick, no increment. So that's a functionality check.\n\nAlso, the step value should be stable when the tick occurs. Because if step changes at the same time as the tick, the increment might use the old or new value. But the spec doesn't mention this, so maybe it's assumed that step is stable when the tick occurs. But since step is a configuration register, perhaps it's set by firmware and should be stable. So maybe an assertion that when a tick occurs, step doesn't change. But that's not specified. The user might not have provided that info, so maybe skip it.\n\nAnother functionality aspect: after a reset, step should have a default value. But the spec doesn't mention a reset value, so maybe that's not required. The SVA can check that upon reset deassertion, step is within 8 bits, but the width assertion already covers that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that step is 8 bits.\n\nConnectivity: When tick is high and active is high, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n\nFunctionality: Same as connectivity, but also considering that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't change. Wait, but the connectivity is about the connection between step and mtime_d via tick. The functionality is about the correct increment when tick occurs. So maybe the same assertion covers both. But perhaps another functionality check is that the step is used correctly in the increment. Also, when there's no tick, mtime doesn't change. So another assertion: if tick is low, then mtime_d remains the same. But the workflow says the mux selects step or zero. Wait, the adder adds either step or zero. So when tick is high, add step; when tick is low, add zero. So mtime_d should be mtime + (tick ? step : 0). So two assertions: one for when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step; when tick is low, mtime_d is mtime. But the user's related signals include 'tick', so these are valid.\n\nBut the user's description says \"When a tick is generated, the mtime register is incremented by the step value.\" So the increment only happens on a tick. So the connectivity assertion is that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. And when tick is low, mtime_d remains the same. But the spec doesn't mention that mtime doesn't change when tick is low. However, the workflow says that the mux selects between step and zero. Wait, perhaps the adder always adds either step (when tick) or zero (when no tick). So mtime_d is always mtime + (tick ? step : 0). Therefore, when tick is low, mtime_d should be mtime + 0, i.e., mtime. So two connectivity assertions: one for tick high, one for tick low.\n\nBut the user's problem is to generate SVAs for 'step', so the step is only involved when tick is high. When tick is low, step isn't used. So the connectivity for step is only relevant when tick is high. Therefore, the main assertion is that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. The case when tick is low doesn't involve step, so maybe that's not part of the step's SVAs. But the step's functionality is to define the increment when there's a tick. So the main SVA for step is the one that checks that when tick occurs, the increment is correct.\n\nAdditionally, considering the active signal: the module might only operate when active is high. So the increment should only happen when active is high. So the assertion should have a condition that active is high. Otherwise, even if tick is high, mtime_d doesn't change. But the spec says \"active: 1-bit module active signal\". So when active is low, the module is inactive. Therefore, the increment should only occur when active is high and tick is high. So the assertion would be: if active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d == mtime + step. If active is low, even with tick high, mtime_d should not change. So that's a functionality check.\n\nAnother point: the step value should not cause mtime to overflow beyond 64 bits. But the spec doesn't mention handling overflow, so perhaps the SVA doesn't need to check that. The mtime is 64-bit, and step is 8-bit, so adding them would wrap around, which is acceptable unless specified otherwise. So no assertion for that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check step is 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Functionality: Same as connectivity, but also check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step.\n\nWait, but how to check that when active is low, the step doesn't affect mtime_d. So another assertion: if active is low, then mtime_d remains the same regardless of tick. But that's a separate assertion. However, since the user asked for SVAs for the 'step' signal, perhaps the main one is the connectivity when active and tick are high. The case when active is low is more about the module being inactive, which might be covered in other assertions, but since step is an input, maybe it's still relevant.\n\nAlternatively, the assertion could be that whenever active is high and tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. And when active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d remains mtime. But how to express that in SVA.\n\nSo for the step signal, the key assertion is that when the module is active and a tick occurs, the step is added to mtime. So the main SVA is:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime + step));\n\nAnother assertion could be that when active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d doesn't change. But that's more about the active signal's effect rather than step. However, since step is involved, maybe it's part of the functionality. But the user's focus is on step, so maybe the main one is the first.\n\nAdditionally, check that step is stable when tick is high. Because if step changes during the same cycle as the tick, the increment might use the old or new value. But the spec doesn't mention this, so maybe it's assumed that step is stable. However, in a synchronous design, step would be a register that's written by firmware, and the tick is generated based on the prescaler. So perhaps step is expected to be stable when tick is high. So an assertion that when tick is high, step doesn't change. But how to check that. The SVA could check that during the same cycle when tick is high, step remains stable. But in Verilog, the value during the posedge is sampled, so if step changes in the same cycle, it might not be captured until the next edge. Hmm, maybe not necessary unless specified.\n\nAlternatively, the step is a configuration register that's only written when the module is inactive. But the spec allows dynamic adjustment, so step can change any time. However, when a tick occurs, the current step value is used. So if step changes in the same cycle as the tick, the mtime_d would use the new value. But the SVA can't assume that; it's up to the design. Since the spec says firmware can dynamically adjust step, but the SVA should check that the increment uses the current step value when the tick occurs. So no need for stability unless specified.\n\nSo the main SVAs for step are:\n\n1. Width: 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity/Functionality: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Also, check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't use step. But how? For example, if active is low and tick is high, then mtime_d should not be mtime + step. So an assertion that (active && tick) is required for the increment. So if active is low, regardless of tick, mtime_d should not be incremented by step. But that's covered by the implication in the first assertion. Because the implication only checks when the antecedent is true. To check that when active is low, the increment doesn't happen, we need another assertion. For example:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime));\n\nBut that's more about the active signal's effect. However, since step is involved in the increment only when active and tick are high, maybe it's part of the step's functionality to ensure that when active is low, step isn't used. But the user's instruction is to generate SVAs for the step signal. So perhaps the main ones are:\n\n- Width check.\n- When active and tick, mtime_d increments by step.\n- When not active, even if tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step.\n\nBut how to express the third. For example:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (!active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime));\n\nBut that's checking that when active is low and tick is high, mtime doesn't change. But the step isn't involved here. However, since step is part of the increment, this assertion would indirectly check that step isn't affecting mtime_d when active is low. But maybe this is part of the connectivity for the active signal. Since the user asked for step's SVAs, perhaps the main ones are the width and the active/tick case.\n\nAnother point: the step value should be non-zero when the tick occurs. But the spec allows step to be zero. For example, if step is zero, then mtime doesn't increment even on a tick. The description says \"Allows flexibility in how quickly the timer counts up. Supports fine or coarse time control based on the step size set by firmware.\" So step can be zero. So no assertion about step being non-zero.\n\nSo the final SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check step is 8 bits.\n2. Functionality/connectivity: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Also, check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step. But how? For example, if active is low and tick is high, mtime_d should be mtime (since the step isn't added). But this is more about the active signal's control over the increment. However, since step is the signal in question, ensuring that it's only used when active is high is part of its functionality.\n\nSo including that assertion would be beneficial. So:\n\nproperty step_increment;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step));\nendproperty\nassert property (step_increment);\n\nproperty no_increment_when_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_increment_when_inactive);\n\nBut the second assertion is more about the active signal, but it's related to step because it ensures that step isn't affecting mtime_d when inactive. However, the user's instruction is to generate SVAs for the step signal. So maybe the second assertion is not strictly necessary for step, but it's part of the functionality that step only affects mtime_d when active and tick. But since the user wants SVAs for step, perhaps the main ones are the width and the active/tick increment.\n\nAnother consideration: the step is an input, so it should be properly connected and not have X or Z values. But that's more of a simulation check and might not be covered by SVA unless specified. The user didn't mention that, so maybe skip it.\n\nSo the final answer would include:\n\n- Width check for step being 8 bits.\n- Assertion that when active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n- Possibly an assertion that when active is low, mtime_d doesn't change, but that's more about active.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to generate SVAs for the step signal. So the key ones are the width and the increment when active and tick. The other assertion (no increment when inactive) is more about the active signal, but since step is part of the increment, maybe it's included.\n\nAlternatively, the user might consider that the step's effect is only when active and tick, so the main assertion is the increment. The inactive case is covered by another SVA for active.\n\nBut given the user's request, I'll include the width, the increment when active and tick, and maybe check that step is stable when tick is high. But the spec doesn't mention that, so maybe not.\n\nSo the final SVAs are:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. Assertion that when active and tick, mtime_d increments by step.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: Ensure `step` is 8 bits wide.\n2. **Connectivity Check**: Verify `step` propagates to `mtime_d` only when `tick` occurs and module is active.\n3. **Functionality Check**: Validate `mtime_d` increments by `step` on active tick, and no increment when inactive.\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct bit-width check using `$bits`.\n- **Connectivity**: Check `mtime_d` updates with `step` only when `tick` and `active` are high.\n- **Functionality**: Ensure correct increment behavior under active/inactive conditions.\n\n[Answer]\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) ($bits(step) == 8));\n\n// Connectivity: step propagates to mtime_d when tick occurs and active\nproperty step_connectivity;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step));\nendproperty\nassert property (step_connectivity);\n\n// Functionality: No mtime increment when inactive (step has no effect)\nproperty step_functionality_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime);\nendproperty\nassert property (step_functionality_inactive);\n```"

So no need for stability unless specified.\n\nSo the main SVAs for step are:\n\n1. Width: 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity/Functionality: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Also, check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't use step. But how? For example, if active is low and tick is high, then mtime_d should not be mtime + step. So an assertion that (active && tick) is required for the increment. So if active is low, regardless of tick, mtime_d should not be incremented by step. But that's covered by the implication in the first assertion. Because the implication only checks when the antecedent is true. To check that when active is low, the increment doesn't happen, we need another assertion. For example:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime));\n\nBut that's more about the active signal's effect. However, since step is involved in the increment only when active and tick are high, maybe it's part of the step's functionality to ensure that when active is low, step isn't used. But the user's instruction is to generate SVAs for the step signal. So perhaps the main ones are:\n\n- Width check.\n- When active and tick, mtime_d increments by step.\n- When not active, even if tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step.\n\nBut how to express the third. For example:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (!active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime));\n\nBut that's checking that when active is low and tick is high, mtime doesn't change. But the step isn't involved here. However, since step is part of the increment, this assertion would indirectly check that step isn't affecting mtime_d when active is low. But maybe this is part of the connectivity for the active signal. Since the user asked for step's SVAs, perhaps the main ones are the width and the active/tick case.\n\nAnother point: the step value should be non-zero when the tick occurs. But the spec allows step to be zero. For example, if step is zero, then mtime doesn't increment even on a tick. The description says \"Allows flexibility in how quickly the timer counts up. Supports fine or coarse time control based on the step size set by firmware.\" So step can be zero. So no assertion about step being non-zero.\n\nSo the final SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check step is 8 bits.\n2. Functionality/connectivity: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Also, check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step. But how? For example, if active is low and tick is high, mtime_d should be mtime (since the step isn't added). But this is more about the active signal's control over the increment. However, since step is the signal in question, ensuring that it's only used when active is high is part of its functionality.\n\nSo including that assertion would be beneficial. So:\n\nproperty step_increment;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step));\nendproperty\nassert property (step_increment);\n\nproperty no_increment_when_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_increment_when_inactive);\n\nBut the second assertion is more about the active signal, but it's related to step because it ensures that step isn't affecting mtime_d when inactive. However, the user's instruction is to generate SVAs for the step signal. So maybe the second assertion is not strictly necessary for step, but it's part of the functionality that step only affects mtime_d when active and tick. But since the user wants SVAs for step, perhaps the main ones are the width and the active/tick increment.\n\nAnother consideration: the step is an input, so it should be properly connected and not have X or Z values. But that's more of a simulation check and might not be covered by SVA unless specified. The user didn't mention that, so maybe skip it.\n\nSo the final answer would include:\n\n- Width check for step being 8 bits.\n- Assertion that when active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n- Possibly an assertion that when active is low, mtime_d doesn't change, but that's more about active.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to generate SVAs for the step signal. So the key ones are the width and the increment when active and tick. The other assertion (no increment when inactive) is more about the active signal, but since step is part of the increment, maybe it's included.\n\nAlternatively, the user might consider that the step's effect is only when active and tick, so the main assertion is the increment. The inactive case is covered by another SVA for active.\n\nBut given the user's request, I'll include the width, the increment when active and tick, and maybe check that step is stable when tick is high. But the spec doesn't mention that, so maybe not.\n\nSo the final SVAs are:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2.

        "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle generating SVAs for the 'step' signal. First, I need to recall the requirements. The user wants assertions that cover width, connectivity, and functionality. Also, they mentioned not to create new signals and stick strictly to the given spec.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. The spec says 'step' is 8-bit. So, I need an assertion that checks the width of 'step' using $bits. That's straightforward: assert that $bits(step) == 8. But wait, in Verilog, the signal might be declared as a reg or wire with a specific width. But the SVA just needs to check the bit width. So the width assertion is covered here.\n\nNext, connectivity. The 'step' is connected to the tick generator and affects mtime. The description says when a tick occurs, mtime increments by step. So connectivity-wise, I need to check that when there's a tick, the next mtime (mtime_d) is current mtime plus step. But wait, the workflow mentions that when a tick is received, the mux selects either step or zero. Wait, the workflow says: \"When a tick is received, a multiplexer selects either the step value or zero.\" Hmm, so maybe the step is added only when there's a tick. So the connectivity here is that when tick is high, mtime_d should be mtime + step. But how is the mux controlled? The description says the mux selects step or zero. So perhaps when tick is active, step is added; otherwise, no increment. So the connectivity assertion would check that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. But the user provided 'tick' as an output. Wait, in the signal list, 'tick' is an output. So the assertion would be: when tick is high, then mtime_d should be mtime + step. But also, when tick is low, mtime_d should remain the same. Wait, but the workflow says the mux selects step or zero. Wait, maybe the adder adds either step or zero. So mtime_d = mtime + (tick ? step : 0). So the connectivity assertion would check that whenever there's a tick, the next mtime is incremented by step. So the property would be: if tick is high, then mtime_d == mtime + step. But how to capture that in SVA? Since mtime_d is the next value, perhaps using a property that checks that at the posedge of clk_i, if tick is high, then mtime_d should be mtime + step. But wait, the tick is generated by the tick generator, which is based on the prescaler. So the tick is an output that pulses when the prescaler counter hits the value. So when tick is high, the step is added. So the connectivity assertion would be that when tick is high, the mtime_d is correctly incremented by step. That's one connectivity check.\n\nAnother connectivity aspect: step is connected to the tick generator. But the tick generator's main function is to generate the tick based on the prescaler. The step is used in the mtime increment, not directly in the tick generation. So maybe the connectivity here is between step and mtime_d via the tick. So the main connectivity is that step affects mtime_d when tick is active.\n\nFor functionality, the step should be an 8-bit value, and when the tick occurs, mtime increments by step. Also, the step should not be zero unless intended, but the spec allows firmware to set it. However, the spec says step is 8-bit, so possible values are 0 to 255. But the functionality assertion would check that whenever a tick occurs, the mtime increments by step. Wait, that's similar to the connectivity check. Maybe the functionality is covered in that assertion. But perhaps there's more. For example, when the module is not active, step might not affect mtime. But the spec says the module assumes the clock is always on, and active is a module active signal. So when active is low, maybe the module is disabled. So the functionality assertion should consider the active signal. Wait, the 'active' signal is an input that activates the module. So when active is low, the module might not function. So the increment should only happen when active is high. So the assertion should check that when active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d is mtime + step. If active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d should not change. But the spec says \"the timer doesnâ€™t consider low-power modes and assumes the clock is neither turned off nor changed during runtime.\" Hmm, but the 'active' signal is part of the inputs. So maybe when active is low, the module is inactive, so the mtime doesn't increment. So the functionality assertion should include the active signal. So the property would be: if active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d is mtime + step. If active is low, even with tick, no increment. So that's a functionality check.\n\nAlso, the step value should be stable when the tick occurs. Because if step changes at the same time as the tick, the increment might use the old or new value. But the spec doesn't mention this, so maybe it's assumed that step is stable when the tick occurs. But since step is a configuration register, perhaps it's set by firmware and should be stable. So maybe an assertion that when a tick occurs, step doesn't change. But that's not specified. The user might not have provided that info, so maybe skip it.\n\nAnother functionality aspect: after a reset, step should have a default value. But the spec doesn't mention a reset value, so maybe that's not required. The SVA can check that upon reset deassertion, step is within 8 bits, but the width assertion already covers that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that step is 8 bits.\n\nConnectivity: When tick is high and active is high, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n\nFunctionality: Same as connectivity, but also considering that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't change. Wait, but the connectivity is about the connection between step and mtime_d via tick. The functionality is about the correct increment when tick occurs. So maybe the same assertion covers both. But perhaps another functionality check is that the step is used correctly in the increment. Also, when there's no tick, mtime doesn't change. So another assertion: if tick is low, then mtime_d remains the same. But the workflow says the mux selects step or zero. Wait, the adder adds either step or zero. So when tick is high, add step; when tick is low, add zero. So mtime_d should be mtime + (tick ? step : 0). So two assertions: one for when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step; when tick is low, mtime_d is mtime. But the user's related signals include 'tick', so these are valid.\n\nBut the user's description says \"When a tick is generated, the mtime register is incremented by the step value.\" So the increment only happens on a tick. So the connectivity assertion is that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. And when tick is low, mtime_d remains the same. But the spec doesn't mention that mtime doesn't change when tick is low. However, the workflow says that the mux selects between step and zero. Wait, perhaps the adder always adds either step (when tick) or zero (when no tick). So mtime_d is always mtime + (tick ? step : 0). Therefore, when tick is low, mtime_d should be mtime + 0, i.e., mtime. So two connectivity assertions: one for tick high, one for tick low.\n\nBut the user's problem is to generate SVAs for 'step', so the step is only involved when tick is high. When tick is low, step isn't used. So the connectivity for step is only relevant when tick is high. Therefore, the main assertion is that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. The case when tick is low doesn't involve step, so maybe that's not part of the step's SVAs. But the step's functionality is to define the increment when there's a tick. So the main SVA for step is the one that checks that when tick occurs, the increment is correct.\n\nAdditionally, considering the active signal: the module might only operate when active is high. So the increment should only happen when active is high. So the assertion should have a condition that active is high. Otherwise, even if tick is high, mtime_d doesn't change. But the spec says \"active: 1-bit module active signal\". So when active is low, the module is inactive. Therefore, the increment should only occur when active is high and tick is high. So the assertion would be: if active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d == mtime + step. If active is low, even with tick high, mtime_d should not change. So that's a functionality check.\n\nAnother point: the step value should not cause mtime to overflow beyond 64 bits. But the spec doesn't mention handling overflow, so perhaps the SVA doesn't need to check that. The mtime is 64-bit, and step is 8-bit, so adding them would wrap around, which is acceptable unless specified otherwise. So no assertion for that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check step is 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Functionality: Same as connectivity, but also check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step.\n\nWait, but how to check that when active is low, the step doesn't affect mtime_d. So another assertion: if active is low, then mtime_d remains the same regardless of tick. But that's a separate assertion. However, since the user asked for SVAs for the 'step' signal, perhaps the main one is the connectivity when active and tick are high. The case when active is low is more about the module being inactive, which might be covered in other assertions, but since step is an input, maybe it's still relevant.\n\nAlternatively, the assertion could be that whenever active is high and tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. And when active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d remains mtime. But how to express that in SVA.\n\nSo for the step signal, the key assertion is that when the module is active and a tick occurs, the step is added to mtime. So the main SVA is:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime + step));\n\nAnother assertion could be that when active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d doesn't change. But that's more about the active signal's effect rather than step. However, since step is involved, maybe it's part of the functionality. But the user's focus is on step, so maybe the main one is the first.\n\nAdditionally, check that step is stable when tick is high. Because if step changes during the same cycle as the tick, the increment might use the old or new value. But the spec doesn't mention this, so maybe it's assumed that step is stable. However, in a synchronous design, step would be a register that's written by firmware, and the tick is generated based on the prescaler. So perhaps step is expected to be stable when tick is high. So an assertion that when tick is high, step doesn't change. But how to check that. The SVA could check that during the same cycle when tick is high, step remains stable. But in Verilog, the value during the posedge is sampled, so if step changes in the same cycle, it might not be captured until the next edge. Hmm, maybe not necessary unless specified.\n\nAlternatively, the step is a configuration register that's only written when the module is inactive. But the spec allows dynamic adjustment, so step can change any time. However, when a tick occurs, the current step value is used. So if step changes in the same cycle as the tick, the mtime_d would use the new value. But the SVA can't assume that; it's up to the design. Since the spec says firmware can dynamically adjust step, but the SVA should check that the increment uses the current step value when the tick occurs. So no need for stability unless specified.\n\nSo the main SVAs for step are:\n\n1. Width: 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity/Functionality: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Also, check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't use step. But how? For example, if active is low and tick is high, then mtime_d should not be mtime + step. So an assertion that (active && tick) is required for the increment. So if active is low, regardless of tick, mtime_d should not be incremented by step. But that's covered by the implication in the first assertion. Because the implication only checks when the antecedent is true. To check that when active is low, the increment doesn't happen, we need another assertion. For example:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime));\n\nBut that's more about the active signal's effect. However, since step is involved in the increment only when active and tick are high, maybe it's part of the step's functionality to ensure that when active is low, step isn't used. But the user's instruction is to generate SVAs for the step signal. So perhaps the main ones are:\n\n- Width check.\n- When active and tick, mtime_d increments by step.\n- When not active, even if tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step.\n\nBut how to express the third. For example:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (!active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime));\n\nBut that's checking that when active is low and tick is high, mtime doesn't change. But the step isn't involved here. However, since step is part of the increment, this assertion would indirectly check that step isn't affecting mtime_d when active is low. But maybe this is part of the connectivity for the active signal. Since the user asked for step's SVAs, perhaps the main ones are the width and the active/tick case.\n\nAnother point: the step value should be non-zero when the tick occurs. But the spec allows step to be zero. For example, if step is zero, then mtime doesn't increment even on a tick. The description says \"Allows flexibility in how quickly the timer counts up. Supports fine or coarse time control based on the step size set by firmware.\" So step can be zero. So no assertion about step being non-zero.\n\nSo the final SVAs would be:\n\n1.

Also, check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step. But how? For example, if active is low and tick is high, mtime_d should be mtime (since the step isn't added). But this is more about the active signal's control over the increment. However, since step is the signal in question, ensuring that it's only used when active is high is part of its functionality.\n\nSo including that assertion would be beneficial. So:\n\nproperty step_increment;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step));\nendproperty\nassert property (step_increment);\n\nproperty no_increment_when_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_increment_when_inactive);\n\nBut the second assertion is more about the active signal, but it's related to step because it ensures that step isn't affecting mtime_d when inactive.

So the key ones are the width and the increment when active and tick. The other assertion (no increment when inactive) is more about the active signal, but since step is part of the increment, maybe it's included.\n\nAlternatively, the user might consider that the step's effect is only when active and tick, so the main assertion is the increment. The inactive case is covered by another SVA for active.\n\nBut given the user's request, I'll include the width, the increment when active and tick, and maybe check that step is stable when tick is high. But the spec doesn't mention that, so maybe not.\n\nSo the final SVAs are:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2.

But the spec doesn't mention that mtime doesn't change when tick is low. However, the workflow says that the mux selects between step and zero. Wait, perhaps the adder always adds either step (when tick) or zero (when no tick). So mtime_d is always mtime + (tick ? step : 0). Therefore, when tick is low, mtime_d should be mtime + 0, i.e., mtime. So two connectivity assertions: one for tick high, one for tick low.\n\nBut the user's problem is to generate SVAs for 'step', so the step is only involved when tick is high. When tick is low, step isn't used. So the connectivity for step is only relevant when tick is high. Therefore, the main assertion is that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. The case when tick is low doesn't involve step, so maybe that's not part of the step's SVAs. But the step's functionality is to define the increment when there's a tick. So the main SVA for step is the one that checks that when tick occurs, the increment is correct.\n\nAdditionally, considering the active signal: the module might only operate when active is high. So the increment should only happen when active is high. So the assertion should have a condition that active is high. Otherwise, even if tick is high, mtime_d doesn't change. But the spec says \"active: 1-bit module active signal\". So when active is low, the module is inactive. Therefore, the increment should only occur when active is high and tick is high. So the assertion would be: if active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d == mtime + step. If active is low, even with tick high, mtime_d should not change. So that's a functionality check.\n\nAnother point: the step value should not cause mtime to overflow beyond 64 bits. But the spec doesn't mention handling overflow, so perhaps the SVA doesn't need to check that. The mtime is 64-bit, and step is 8-bit, so adding them would wrap around, which is acceptable unless specified otherwise. So no assertion for that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check step is 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Functionality: Same as connectivity, but also check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step.\n\nWait, but how to check that when active is low, the step doesn't affect mtime_d. So another assertion: if active is low, then mtime_d remains the same regardless of tick. But that's a separate assertion. However, since the user asked for SVAs for the 'step' signal, perhaps the main one is the connectivity when active and tick are high. The case when active is low is more about the module being inactive, which might be covered in other assertions, but since step is an input, maybe it's still relevant.\n\nAlternatively, the assertion could be that whenever active is high and tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. And when active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d remains mtime. But how to express that in SVA.\n\nSo for the step signal, the key assertion is that when the module is active and a tick occurs, the step is added to mtime. So the main SVA is:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime + step));\n\nAnother assertion could be that when active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d doesn't change. But that's more about the active signal's effect rather than step. However, since step is involved, maybe it's part of the functionality. But the user's focus is on step, so maybe the main one is the first.\n\nAdditionally, check that step is stable when tick is high. Because if step changes during the same cycle as the tick, the increment might use the old or new value. But the spec doesn't mention this, so maybe it's assumed that step is stable. However, in a synchronous design, step would be a register that's written by firmware, and the tick is generated based on the prescaler. So perhaps step is expected to be stable when tick is high. So an assertion that when tick is high, step doesn't change. But how to check that. The SVA could check that during the same cycle when tick is high, step remains stable. But in Verilog, the value during the posedge is sampled, so if step changes in the same cycle, it might not be captured until the next edge. Hmm, maybe not necessary unless specified.\n\nAlternatively, the step is a configuration register that's only written when the module is inactive. But the spec allows dynamic adjustment, so step can change any time. However, when a tick occurs, the current step value is used. So if step changes in the same cycle as the tick, the mtime_d would use the new value. But the SVA can't assume that; it's up to the design. Since the spec says firmware can dynamically adjust step, but the SVA should check that the increment uses the current step value when the tick occurs. So no need for stability unless specified.\n\nSo the main SVAs for step are:\n\n1. Width: 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity/Functionality: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Also, check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't use step. But how? For example, if active is low and tick is high, then mtime_d should not be mtime + step. So an assertion that (active && tick) is required for the increment. So if active is low, regardless of tick, mtime_d should not be incremented by step. But that's covered by the implication in the first assertion. Because the implication only checks when the antecedent is true. To check that when active is low, the increment doesn't happen, we need another assertion. For example:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime));\n\nBut that's more about the active signal's effect. However, since step is involved in the increment only when active and tick are high, maybe it's part of the step's functionality to ensure that when active is low, step isn't used. But the user's instruction is to generate SVAs for the step signal. So perhaps the main ones are:\n\n- Width check.\n- When active and tick, mtime_d increments by step.\n- When not active, even if tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step.\n\nBut how to express the third. For example:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (!active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime));\n\nBut that's checking that when active is low and tick is high, mtime doesn't change. But the step isn't involved here. However, since step is part of the increment, this assertion would indirectly check that step isn't affecting mtime_d when active is low. But maybe this is part of the connectivity for the active signal. Since the user asked for step's SVAs, perhaps the main ones are the width and the active/tick case.\n\nAnother point: the step value should be non-zero when the tick occurs. But the spec allows step to be zero. For example, if step is zero, then mtime doesn't increment even on a tick. The description says \"Allows flexibility in how quickly the timer counts up. Supports fine or coarse time control based on the step size set by firmware.\" So step can be zero. So no assertion about step being non-zero.\n\nSo the final SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check step is 8 bits.\n2. Functionality/connectivity: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Also, check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step. But how? For example, if active is low and tick is high, mtime_d should be mtime (since the step isn't added). But this is more about the active signal's control over the increment. However, since step is the signal in question, ensuring that it's only used when active is high is part of its functionality.\n\nSo including that assertion would be beneficial. So:\n\nproperty step_increment;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step));\nendproperty\nassert property (step_increment);\n\nproperty no_increment_when_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_increment_when_inactive);\n\nBut the second assertion is more about the active signal, but it's related to step because it ensures that step isn't affecting mtime_d when inactive. However, the user's instruction is to generate SVAs for the step signal. So maybe the second assertion is not strictly necessary for step, but it's part of the functionality that step only affects mtime_d when active and tick. But since the user wants SVAs for step, perhaps the main ones are the width and the active/tick increment.\n\nAnother consideration: the step is an input, so it should be properly connected and not have X or Z values. But that's more of a simulation check and might not be covered by SVA unless specified. The user didn't mention that, so maybe skip it.\n\nSo the final answer would include:\n\n- Width check for step being 8 bits.\n- Assertion that when active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n- Possibly an assertion that when active is low, mtime_d doesn't change, but that's more about active.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to generate SVAs for the step signal. So the key ones are the width and the increment when active and tick. The other assertion (no increment when inactive) is more about the active signal, but since step is part of the increment, maybe it's included.\n\nAlternatively, the user might consider that the step's effect is only when active and tick, so the main assertion is the increment. The inactive case is covered by another SVA for active.\n\nBut given the user's request, I'll include the width, the increment when active and tick, and maybe check that step is stable when tick is high. But the spec doesn't mention that, so maybe not.\n\nSo the final SVAs are:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. Assertion that when active and tick, mtime_d increments by step.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: Ensure `step` is 8 bits wide.\n2. **Connectivity Check**: Verify `step` propagates to `mtime_d` only when `tick` occurs and module is active.\n3. **Functionality Check**: Validate `mtime_d` increments by `step` on active tick, and no increment when inactive.\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct bit-width check using `$bits`.\n- **Connectivity**: Check `mtime_d` updates with `step` only when `tick` and `active` are high.\n- **Functionality**: Ensure correct increment behavior under active/inactive conditions.\n\n[Answer]\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) ($bits(step) == 8));\n\n// Connectivity: step propagates to mtime_d when tick occurs and active\nproperty step_connectivity;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step));\nendproperty\nassert property (step_connectivity);\n\n// Functionality: No mtime increment when inactive (step has no effect)\nproperty step_functionality_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime);\nendproperty\nassert property (step_functionality_inactive);\n```": [
            "Timer HWIP Technical Specification\n\nOverview\n\nThis document specifies RISC-V Timer hardware IP functionality. This module conforms to\n\nthe Comportable guideline for peripheral functionality. See that document for integration\n\noverview within the broader top level system.\n\nFeatures\n\ne 64-bit timer with 12-bit prescaler and 8-bit step register\ne Compliant with RISC-V privileged specification v1.11\ne Configurable number of timers per hart and number of harts\n\nDescription\n\nThe timer module provides a configurable number of 64-bit counters where each counter\nincrements by a step value whenever the prescaler times out. Each timer generates an\ninterrupt if the counter reaches (or is above) a programmed value. The timer is intended to\nbe used by the processors to check the current time relative to the reset or the system\npower-on.\n\nIn this version, the timer doesnâ€™t consider low-power modes and assumes the clock is\nneither turned off nor changed during runtime.\n\nCompatibility\nThe timer IP provides memory-mapped registers equivalent to mtime and mtimecmp which\ncan be used as the machine-mode timer registers defined in the RISC-V privileged spec.\n\nAdditional features such as prescaler, step, and a configurable number of timers and harts\nhave been added.\n\nTheory of Operation\n\nBlock Diagram\n\nclk_fixed expired\n\ntick[#Harts-1:0]\n\ntick gen :\n\nThe timer module is composed of tick generators, counters, and comparators. A tick\ngenerator creates a tick every time its internal counter hits the CFG@.prescaler value. The\ntick is used to increment mtime by the CFG@.step value. The 64-bit mtime value is\ncompared with the 64-bit mtimecmp. If mtime is greater than or equal to mtimecmp, the\ntimer raises an interrupt.\n\nmtimecmp\nprescaler\n\nDesign Details\n\nTick Generator\n\nThe tick module inside the timer IP is used to generate a fixed period of pulse signal. This\nallows creation of a call-clock timer tick such as 1us or 10us regardless of the system clock\nperiod. It is useful if the system has more than one clock as a clock source. The firmware\njust needs to adjust the CFG@.prescaler value and the actual timer interrupt handling\nroutine does not need a variable clock period to update mt imecmp.\n\nFor instance, if a system switches between 48MHz and 200MHz clocks, a prescaler value of\n47 for 48MHz and 199 for 200MHz will generate a 1us tick. In this version, the timer only\nsupports a single fixed clock, so the firmware should change CFG@.prescaler\nappropriately.\n\nConfigurable number of timers and harts\n\nThe timer IP supports more than one HART and/or more than one timer per hart. Each hart\nhas a set of tick generator and counter. It means the timer IP has the same number of\nprescalers, steps, and mtime registers as the number of harts.\n\nEach hart can have multiple sets of mt imecmp, comparator logic, and expire interrupt\nsignals. This version of the IP is fixed to have one Hart and one Timer per Hart.\n\nHere is the mapping information:\r\n[clk_i]: 1-bit clock input to the tick generator  \r\n[rst_ni]: 1-bit active low reset signal  \r\n[active]: 1-bit module active signal  \r\n[prescaler]: 12-bit prescaler value input for the tick generator  \r\n[step]: 8-bit step value for incrementing mtime  \r\n[mtime]: 64-bit current time value  \r\n[mtimecmp]: Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime, one per hart  \r\n[tick]: 1-bit tick output signal  \r\n[mtime_d]: 64-bit next value of mtime register  \r\n[intr]: N-bit array of interrupt output signals, one per hart  \r\n\r\nHere is the architecture overview:\r\n{\r\n  \"TimerModule\": {\r\n    \"TheoryOfOperation\": {\r\n      \"BlockDiagram\": {\r\n        \"Inputs\": {\r\n          \"clk_i\": \"Clock input to the tick generator\",\r\n          \"rst_ni\": \"Active low reset signal\",\r\n          \"active\": \"Module active signal\",\r\n          \"prescaler\": \"12-bit prescaler value input for the tick generator\",\r\n          \"step\": \"8-bit step value for incrementing mtime\",\r\n          \"mtime\": \"64-bit current time value\",\r\n          \"mtimecmp\": \"Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"Outputs\": {\r\n          \"tick\": \"Tick output signal\",\r\n          \"mtime_d\": \"64-bit next time value\",\r\n          \"intr\": \"Interrupt output signals array\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"TickGenerator\": {\r\n          \"Description\": \"Creates a tick every time its internal counter hits the given prescaler value.

            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle generating SVAs for the 'step' signal. First, I need to recall the requirements. The user wants assertions that cover width, connectivity, and functionality. Also, they mentioned not to create new signals and stick strictly to the given spec.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. The spec says 'step' is 8-bit. So, I need an assertion that checks the width of 'step' using $bits. That's straightforward: assert that $bits(step) == 8. But wait, in Verilog, the signal might be declared as a reg or wire with a specific width. But the SVA just needs to check the bit width. So the width assertion is covered here.\n\nNext, connectivity. The 'step' is connected to the tick generator and affects mtime. The description says when a tick occurs, mtime increments by step. So connectivity-wise, I need to check that when there's a tick, the next mtime (mtime_d) is current mtime plus step. But wait, the workflow mentions that when a tick is received, the mux selects either step or zero. Wait, the workflow says: \"When a tick is received, a multiplexer selects either the step value or zero.\" Hmm, so maybe the step is added only when there's a tick. So the connectivity here is that when tick is high, mtime_d should be mtime + step. But how is the mux controlled? The description says the mux selects step or zero. So perhaps when tick is active, step is added; otherwise, no increment. So the connectivity assertion would check that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. But the user provided 'tick' as an output. Wait, in the signal list, 'tick' is an output. So the assertion would be: when tick is high, then mtime_d should be mtime + step. But also, when tick is low, mtime_d should remain the same. Wait, but the workflow says the mux selects step or zero. Wait, maybe the adder adds either step or zero. So mtime_d = mtime + (tick ? step : 0). So the connectivity assertion would check that whenever there's a tick, the next mtime is incremented by step. So the property would be: if tick is high, then mtime_d == mtime + step. But how to capture that in SVA? Since mtime_d is the next value, perhaps using a property that checks that at the posedge of clk_i, if tick is high, then mtime_d should be mtime + step. But wait, the tick is generated by the tick generator, which is based on the prescaler. So the tick is an output that pulses when the prescaler counter hits the value. So when tick is high, the step is added. So the connectivity assertion would be that when tick is high, the mtime_d is correctly incremented by step. That's one connectivity check.\n\nAnother connectivity aspect: step is connected to the tick generator. But the tick generator's main function is to generate the tick based on the prescaler. The step is used in the mtime increment, not directly in the tick generation. So maybe the connectivity here is between step and mtime_d via the tick. So the main connectivity is that step affects mtime_d when tick is active.\n\nFor functionality, the step should be an 8-bit value, and when the tick occurs, mtime increments by step. Also, the step should not be zero unless intended, but the spec allows firmware to set it. However, the spec says step is 8-bit, so possible values are 0 to 255. But the functionality assertion would check that whenever a tick occurs, the mtime increments by step. Wait, that's similar to the connectivity check. Maybe the functionality is covered in that assertion. But perhaps there's more. For example, when the module is not active, step might not affect mtime. But the spec says the module assumes the clock is always on, and active is a module active signal. So when active is low, maybe the module is disabled. So the functionality assertion should consider the active signal. Wait, the 'active' signal is an input that activates the module. So when active is low, the module might not function. So the increment should only happen when active is high. So the assertion should check that when active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d is mtime + step. If active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d should not change. But the spec says \"the timer doesnâ€™t consider low-power modes and assumes the clock is neither turned off nor changed during runtime.\" Hmm, but the 'active' signal is part of the inputs. So maybe when active is low, the module is inactive, so the mtime doesn't increment. So the functionality assertion should include the active signal. So the property would be: if active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d is mtime + step. If active is low, even with tick, no increment. So that's a functionality check.\n\nAlso, the step value should be stable when the tick occurs. Because if step changes at the same time as the tick, the increment might use the old or new value. But the spec doesn't mention this, so maybe it's assumed that step is stable when the tick occurs. But since step is a configuration register, perhaps it's set by firmware and should be stable. So maybe an assertion that when a tick occurs, step doesn't change. But that's not specified. The user might not have provided that info, so maybe skip it.\n\nAnother functionality aspect: after a reset, step should have a default value. But the spec doesn't mention a reset value, so maybe that's not required. The SVA can check that upon reset deassertion, step is within 8 bits, but the width assertion already covers that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that step is 8 bits.\n\nConnectivity: When tick is high and active is high, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n\nFunctionality: Same as connectivity, but also considering that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't change. Wait, but the connectivity is about the connection between step and mtime_d via tick. The functionality is about the correct increment when tick occurs. So maybe the same assertion covers both. But perhaps another functionality check is that the step is used correctly in the increment. Also, when there's no tick, mtime doesn't change. So another assertion: if tick is low, then mtime_d remains the same. But the workflow says the mux selects step or zero. Wait, the adder adds either step or zero. So when tick is high, add step; when tick is low, add zero. So mtime_d should be mtime + (tick ? step : 0). So two assertions: one for when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step; when tick is low, mtime_d is mtime. But the user's related signals include 'tick', so these are valid.\n\nBut the user's description says \"When a tick is generated, the mtime register is incremented by the step value.\" So the increment only happens on a tick. So the connectivity assertion is that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. And when tick is low, mtime_d remains the same. But the spec doesn't mention that mtime doesn't change when tick is low. However, the workflow says that the mux selects between step and zero. Wait, perhaps the adder always adds either step (when tick) or zero (when no tick). So mtime_d is always mtime + (tick ? step : 0). Therefore, when tick is low, mtime_d should be mtime + 0, i.e., mtime. So two connectivity assertions: one for tick high, one for tick low.\n\nBut the user's problem is to generate SVAs for 'step', so the step is only involved when tick is high. When tick is low, step isn't used. So the connectivity for step is only relevant when tick is high. Therefore, the main assertion is that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. The case when tick is low doesn't involve step, so maybe that's not part of the step's SVAs. But the step's functionality is to define the increment when there's a tick. So the main SVA for step is the one that checks that when tick occurs, the increment is correct.\n\nAdditionally, considering the active signal: the module might only operate when active is high. So the increment should only happen when active is high. So the assertion should have a condition that active is high. Otherwise, even if tick is high, mtime_d doesn't change. But the spec says \"active: 1-bit module active signal\". So when active is low, the module is inactive. Therefore, the increment should only occur when active is high and tick is high. So the assertion would be: if active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d == mtime + step. If active is low, even with tick high, mtime_d should not change. So that's a functionality check.\n\nAnother point: the step value should not cause mtime to overflow beyond 64 bits. But the spec doesn't mention handling overflow, so perhaps the SVA doesn't need to check that. The mtime is 64-bit, and step is 8-bit, so adding them would wrap around, which is acceptable unless specified otherwise. So no assertion for that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check step is 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Functionality: Same as connectivity, but also check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step.\n\nWait, but how to check that when active is low, the step doesn't affect mtime_d. So another assertion: if active is low, then mtime_d remains the same regardless of tick. But that's a separate assertion. However, since the user asked for SVAs for the 'step' signal, perhaps the main one is the connectivity when active and tick are high. The case when active is low is more about the module being inactive, which might be covered in other assertions, but since step is an input, maybe it's still relevant.\n\nAlternatively, the assertion could be that whenever active is high and tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. And when active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d remains mtime. But how to express that in SVA.\n\nSo for the step signal, the key assertion is that when the module is active and a tick occurs, the step is added to mtime. So the main SVA is:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime + step));\n\nAnother assertion could be that when active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d doesn't change. But that's more about the active signal's effect rather than step. However, since step is involved, maybe it's part of the functionality. But the user's focus is on step, so maybe the main one is the first.\n\nAdditionally, check that step is stable when tick is high. Because if step changes during the same cycle as the tick, the increment might use the old or new value. But the spec doesn't mention this, so maybe it's assumed that step is stable. However, in a synchronous design, step would be a register that's written by firmware, and the tick is generated based on the prescaler. So perhaps step is expected to be stable when tick is high. So an assertion that when tick is high, step doesn't change. But how to check that. The SVA could check that during the same cycle when tick is high, step remains stable. But in Verilog, the value during the posedge is sampled, so if step changes in the same cycle, it might not be captured until the next edge. Hmm, maybe not necessary unless specified.\n\nAlternatively, the step is a configuration register that's only written when the module is inactive. But the spec allows dynamic adjustment, so step can change any time. However, when a tick occurs, the current step value is used. So if step changes in the same cycle as the tick, the mtime_d would use the new value. But the SVA can't assume that; it's up to the design. Since the spec says firmware can dynamically adjust step, but the SVA should check that the increment uses the current step value when the tick occurs. So no need for stability unless specified.\n\nSo the main SVAs for step are:\n\n1. Width: 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity/Functionality: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Also, check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't use step. But how? For example, if active is low and tick is high, then mtime_d should not be mtime + step. So an assertion that (active && tick) is required for the increment. So if active is low, regardless of tick, mtime_d should not be incremented by step. But that's covered by the implication in the first assertion. Because the implication only checks when the antecedent is true. To check that when active is low, the increment doesn't happen, we need another assertion. For example:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime));\n\nBut that's more about the active signal's effect. However, since step is involved in the increment only when active and tick are high, maybe it's part of the step's functionality to ensure that when active is low, step isn't used. But the user's instruction is to generate SVAs for the step signal. So perhaps the main ones are:\n\n- Width check.\n- When active and tick, mtime_d increments by step.\n- When not active, even if tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step.\n\nBut how to express the third. For example:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (!active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime));\n\nBut that's checking that when active is low and tick is high, mtime doesn't change. But the step isn't involved here. However, since step is part of the increment, this assertion would indirectly check that step isn't affecting mtime_d when active is low. But maybe this is part of the connectivity for the active signal. Since the user asked for step's SVAs, perhaps the main ones are the width and the active/tick case.\n\nAnother point: the step value should be non-zero when the tick occurs. But the spec allows step to be zero. For example, if step is zero, then mtime doesn't increment even on a tick. The description says \"Allows flexibility in how quickly the timer counts up. Supports fine or coarse time control based on the step size set by firmware.\" So step can be zero. So no assertion about step being non-zero.\n\nSo the final SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check step is 8 bits.\n2. Functionality/connectivity: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Also, check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step. But how? For example, if active is low and tick is high, mtime_d should be mtime (since the step isn't added). But this is more about the active signal's control over the increment. However, since step is the signal in question, ensuring that it's only used when active is high is part of its functionality.\n\nSo including that assertion would be beneficial. So:\n\nproperty step_increment;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step));\nendproperty\nassert property (step_increment);\n\nproperty no_increment_when_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_increment_when_inactive);\n\nBut the second assertion is more about the active signal, but it's related to step because it ensures that step isn't affecting mtime_d when inactive. However, the user's instruction is to generate SVAs for the step signal. So maybe the second assertion is not strictly necessary for step, but it's part of the functionality that step only affects mtime_d when active and tick. But since the user wants SVAs for step, perhaps the main ones are the width and the active/tick increment.\n\nAnother consideration: the step is an input, so it should be properly connected and not have X or Z values. But that's more of a simulation check and might not be covered by SVA unless specified. The user didn't mention that, so maybe skip it.\n\nSo the final answer would include:\n\n- Width check for step being 8 bits.\n- Assertion that when active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n- Possibly an assertion that when active is low, mtime_d doesn't change, but that's more about active.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to generate SVAs for the step signal. So the key ones are the width and the increment when active and tick. The other assertion (no increment when inactive) is more about the active signal, but since step is part of the increment, maybe it's included.\n\nAlternatively, the user might consider that the step's effect is only when active and tick, so the main assertion is the increment. The inactive case is covered by another SVA for active.\n\nBut given the user's request, I'll include the width, the increment when active and tick, and maybe check that step is stable when tick is high. But the spec doesn't mention that, so maybe not.\n\nSo the final SVAs are:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2.

        "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle generating SVAs for the 'step' signal. First, I need to recall the requirements. The user wants assertions that cover width, connectivity, and functionality. Also, they mentioned not to create new signals and stick strictly to the given spec.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. The spec says 'step' is 8-bit. So, I need an assertion that checks the width of 'step' using $bits. That's straightforward: assert that $bits(step) == 8. But wait, in Verilog, the signal might be declared as a reg or wire with a specific width. But the SVA just needs to check the bit width. So the width assertion is covered here.\n\nNext, connectivity. The 'step' is connected to the tick generator and affects mtime. The description says when a tick occurs, mtime increments by step. So connectivity-wise, I need to check that when there's a tick, the next mtime (mtime_d) is current mtime plus step. But wait, the workflow mentions that when a tick is received, the mux selects either step or zero. Wait, the workflow says: \"When a tick is received, a multiplexer selects either the step value or zero.\" Hmm, so maybe the step is added only when there's a tick. So the connectivity here is that when tick is high, mtime_d should be mtime + step. But how is the mux controlled? The description says the mux selects step or zero. So perhaps when tick is active, step is added; otherwise, no increment. So the connectivity assertion would check that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. But the user provided 'tick' as an output. Wait, in the signal list, 'tick' is an output. So the assertion would be: when tick is high, then mtime_d should be mtime + step. But also, when tick is low, mtime_d should remain the same. Wait, but the workflow says the mux selects step or zero. Wait, maybe the adder adds either step or zero. So mtime_d = mtime + (tick ? step : 0). So the connectivity assertion would check that whenever there's a tick, the next mtime is incremented by step. So the property would be: if tick is high, then mtime_d == mtime + step. But how to capture that in SVA? Since mtime_d is the next value, perhaps using a property that checks that at the posedge of clk_i, if tick is high, then mtime_d should be mtime + step. But wait, the tick is generated by the tick generator, which is based on the prescaler. So the tick is an output that pulses when the prescaler counter hits the value. So when tick is high, the step is added. So the connectivity assertion would be that when tick is high, the mtime_d is correctly incremented by step. That's one connectivity check.\n\nAnother connectivity aspect: step is connected to the tick generator. But the tick generator's main function is to generate the tick based on the prescaler. The step is used in the mtime increment, not directly in the tick generation. So maybe the connectivity here is between step and mtime_d via the tick. So the main connectivity is that step affects mtime_d when tick is active.\n\nFor functionality, the step should be an 8-bit value, and when the tick occurs, mtime increments by step. Also, the step should not be zero unless intended, but the spec allows firmware to set it. However, the spec says step is 8-bit, so possible values are 0 to 255. But the functionality assertion would check that whenever a tick occurs, the mtime increments by step. Wait, that's similar to the connectivity check. Maybe the functionality is covered in that assertion. But perhaps there's more. For example, when the module is not active, step might not affect mtime. But the spec says the module assumes the clock is always on, and active is a module active signal. So when active is low, maybe the module is disabled. So the functionality assertion should consider the active signal. Wait, the 'active' signal is an input that activates the module. So when active is low, the module might not function. So the increment should only happen when active is high. So the assertion should check that when active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d is mtime + step. If active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d should not change. But the spec says \"the timer doesnâ€™t consider low-power modes and assumes the clock is neither turned off nor changed during runtime.\" Hmm, but the 'active' signal is part of the inputs. So maybe when active is low, the module is inactive, so the mtime doesn't increment. So the functionality assertion should include the active signal. So the property would be: if active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d is mtime + step. If active is low, even with tick, no increment. So that's a functionality check.\n\nAlso, the step value should be stable when the tick occurs. Because if step changes at the same time as the tick, the increment might use the old or new value. But the spec doesn't mention this, so maybe it's assumed that step is stable when the tick occurs. But since step is a configuration register, perhaps it's set by firmware and should be stable. So maybe an assertion that when a tick occurs, step doesn't change. But that's not specified. The user might not have provided that info, so maybe skip it.\n\nAnother functionality aspect: after a reset, step should have a default value. But the spec doesn't mention a reset value, so maybe that's not required. The SVA can check that upon reset deassertion, step is within 8 bits, but the width assertion already covers that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that step is 8 bits.\n\nConnectivity: When tick is high and active is high, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n\nFunctionality: Same as connectivity, but also considering that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't change. Wait, but the connectivity is about the connection between step and mtime_d via tick. The functionality is about the correct increment when tick occurs. So maybe the same assertion covers both. But perhaps another functionality check is that the step is used correctly in the increment. Also, when there's no tick, mtime doesn't change. So another assertion: if tick is low, then mtime_d remains the same. But the workflow says the mux selects step or zero. Wait, the adder adds either step or zero. So when tick is high, add step; when tick is low, add zero. So mtime_d should be mtime + (tick ? step : 0). So two assertions: one for when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step; when tick is low, mtime_d is mtime. But the user's related signals include 'tick', so these are valid.\n\nBut the user's description says \"When a tick is generated, the mtime register is incremented by the step value.\" So the increment only happens on a tick. So the connectivity assertion is that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. And when tick is low, mtime_d remains the same. But the spec doesn't mention that mtime doesn't change when tick is low. However, the workflow says that the mux selects between step and zero. Wait, perhaps the adder always adds either step (when tick) or zero (when no tick). So mtime_d is always mtime + (tick ? step : 0). Therefore, when tick is low, mtime_d should be mtime + 0, i.e., mtime. So two connectivity assertions: one for tick high, one for tick low.\n\nBut the user's problem is to generate SVAs for 'step', so the step is only involved when tick is high. When tick is low, step isn't used. So the connectivity for step is only relevant when tick is high. Therefore, the main assertion is that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. The case when tick is low doesn't involve step, so maybe that's not part of the step's SVAs. But the step's functionality is to define the increment when there's a tick. So the main SVA for step is the one that checks that when tick occurs, the increment is correct.\n\nAdditionally, considering the active signal: the module might only operate when active is high. So the increment should only happen when active is high. So the assertion should have a condition that active is high. Otherwise, even if tick is high, mtime_d doesn't change. But the spec says \"active: 1-bit module active signal\". So when active is low, the module is inactive. Therefore, the increment should only occur when active is high and tick is high. So the assertion would be: if active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d == mtime + step. If active is low, even with tick high, mtime_d should not change. So that's a functionality check.\n\nAnother point: the step value should not cause mtime to overflow beyond 64 bits. But the spec doesn't mention handling overflow, so perhaps the SVA doesn't need to check that. The mtime is 64-bit, and step is 8-bit, so adding them would wrap around, which is acceptable unless specified otherwise. So no assertion for that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check step is 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Functionality: Same as connectivity, but also check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step.\n\nWait, but how to check that when active is low, the step doesn't affect mtime_d.

And when active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d remains mtime. But how to express that in SVA.\n\nSo for the step signal, the key assertion is that when the module is active and a tick occurs, the step is added to mtime. So the main SVA is:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime + step));\n\nAnother assertion could be that when active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d doesn't change. But that's more about the active signal's effect rather than step. However, since step is involved, maybe it's part of the functionality. But the user's focus is on step, so maybe the main one is the first.\n\nAdditionally, check that step is stable when tick is high.

But in Verilog, the value during the posedge is sampled, so if step changes in the same cycle, it might not be captured until the next edge.

But the spec allows dynamic adjustment, so step can change any time. However, when a tick occurs, the current step value is used.

Since the spec says firmware can dynamically adjust step, but the SVA should check that the increment uses the current step value when the tick occurs. So no need for stability unless specified.\n\nSo the main SVAs for step are:\n\n1. Width: 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity/Functionality: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Also, check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't use step. But how? For example, if active is low and tick is high, then mtime_d should not be mtime + step.

For example:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime));\n\nBut that's more about the active signal's effect. However, since step is involved in the increment only when active and tick are high, maybe it's part of the step's functionality to ensure that when active is low, step isn't used.

Maybe the functionality is covered in that assertion. But perhaps there's more. For example, when the module is not active, step might not affect mtime. But the spec says the module assumes the clock is always on, and active is a module active signal. So when active is low, maybe the module is disabled. So the functionality assertion should consider the active signal. Wait, the 'active' signal is an input that activates the module. So when active is low, the module might not function. So the increment should only happen when active is high. So the assertion should check that when active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d is mtime + step. If active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d should not change. But the spec says \"the timer doesnâ€™t consider low-power modes and assumes the clock is neither turned off nor changed during runtime.\" Hmm, but the 'active' signal is part of the inputs. So maybe when active is low, the module is inactive, so the mtime doesn't increment. So the functionality assertion should include the active signal. So the property would be: if active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d is mtime + step. If active is low, even with tick, no increment. So that's a functionality check.\n\nAlso, the step value should be stable when the tick occurs. Because if step changes at the same time as the tick, the increment might use the old or new value. But the spec doesn't mention this, so maybe it's assumed that step is stable when the tick occurs. But since step is a configuration register, perhaps it's set by firmware and should be stable. So maybe an assertion that when a tick occurs, step doesn't change. But that's not specified. The user might not have provided that info, so maybe skip it.\n\nAnother functionality aspect: after a reset, step should have a default value. But the spec doesn't mention a reset value, so maybe that's not required. The SVA can check that upon reset deassertion, step is within 8 bits, but the width assertion already covers that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that step is 8 bits.\n\nConnectivity: When tick is high and active is high, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n\nFunctionality: Same as connectivity, but also considering that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't change. Wait, but the connectivity is about the connection between step and mtime_d via tick. The functionality is about the correct increment when tick occurs. So maybe the same assertion covers both. But perhaps another functionality check is that the step is used correctly in the increment. Also, when there's no tick, mtime doesn't change. So another assertion: if tick is low, then mtime_d remains the same. But the workflow says the mux selects step or zero. Wait, the adder adds either step or zero. So when tick is high, add step; when tick is low, add zero. So mtime_d should be mtime + (tick ? step : 0). So two assertions: one for when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step; when tick is low, mtime_d is mtime. But the user's related signals include 'tick', so these are valid.\n\nBut the user's description says \"When a tick is generated, the mtime register is incremented by the step value.\" So the increment only happens on a tick. So the connectivity assertion is that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. And when tick is low, mtime_d remains the same. But the spec doesn't mention that mtime doesn't change when tick is low. However, the workflow says that the mux selects between step and zero. Wait, perhaps the adder always adds either step (when tick) or zero (when no tick). So mtime_d is always mtime + (tick ? step : 0). Therefore, when tick is low, mtime_d should be mtime + 0, i.e., mtime. So two connectivity assertions: one for tick high, one for tick low.\n\nBut the user's problem is to generate SVAs for 'step', so the step is only involved when tick is high. When tick is low, step isn't used. So the connectivity for step is only relevant when tick is high. Therefore, the main assertion is that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. The case when tick is low doesn't involve step, so maybe that's not part of the step's SVAs. But the step's functionality is to define the increment when there's a tick. So the main SVA for step is the one that checks that when tick occurs, the increment is correct.\n\nAdditionally, considering the active signal: the module might only operate when active is high. So the increment should only happen when active is high. So the assertion should have a condition that active is high. Otherwise, even if tick is high, mtime_d doesn't change. But the spec says \"active: 1-bit module active signal\". So when active is low, the module is inactive. Therefore, the increment should only occur when active is high and tick is high. So the assertion would be: if active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d == mtime + step. If active is low, even with tick high, mtime_d should not change. So that's a functionality check.\n\nAnother point: the step value should not cause mtime to overflow beyond 64 bits. But the spec doesn't mention handling overflow, so perhaps the SVA doesn't need to check that. The mtime is 64-bit, and step is 8-bit, so adding them would wrap around, which is acceptable unless specified otherwise. So no assertion for that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check step is 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Functionality: Same as connectivity, but also check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step.\n\nWait, but how to check that when active is low, the step doesn't affect mtime_d. So another assertion: if active is low, then mtime_d remains the same regardless of tick. But that's a separate assertion. However, since the user asked for SVAs for the 'step' signal, perhaps the main one is the connectivity when active and tick are high. The case when active is low is more about the module being inactive, which might be covered in other assertions, but since step is an input, maybe it's still relevant.\n\nAlternatively, the assertion could be that whenever active is high and tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. And when active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d remains mtime. But how to express that in SVA.\n\nSo for the step signal, the key assertion is that when the module is active and a tick occurs, the step is added to mtime. So the main SVA is:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime + step));\n\nAnother assertion could be that when active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d doesn't change. But that's more about the active signal's effect rather than step. However, since step is involved, maybe it's part of the functionality. But the user's focus is on step, so maybe the main one is the first.\n\nAdditionally, check that step is stable when tick is high. Because if step changes during the same cycle as the tick, the increment might use the old or new value. But the spec doesn't mention this, so maybe it's assumed that step is stable. However, in a synchronous design, step would be a register that's written by firmware, and the tick is generated based on the prescaler. So perhaps step is expected to be stable when tick is high. So an assertion that when tick is high, step doesn't change. But how to check that. The SVA could check that during the same cycle when tick is high, step remains stable. But in Verilog, the value during the posedge is sampled, so if step changes in the same cycle, it might not be captured until the next edge. Hmm, maybe not necessary unless specified.\n\nAlternatively, the step is a configuration register that's only written when the module is inactive. But the spec allows dynamic adjustment, so step can change any time. However, when a tick occurs, the current step value is used. So if step changes in the same cycle as the tick, the mtime_d would use the new value. But the SVA can't assume that; it's up to the design. Since the spec says firmware can dynamically adjust step, but the SVA should check that the increment uses the current step value when the tick occurs. So no need for stability unless specified.\n\nSo the main SVAs for step are:\n\n1. Width: 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity/Functionality: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Also, check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't use step. But how? For example, if active is low and tick is high, then mtime_d should not be mtime + step. So an assertion that (active && tick) is required for the increment. So if active is low, regardless of tick, mtime_d should not be incremented by step. But that's covered by the implication in the first assertion. Because the implication only checks when the antecedent is true. To check that when active is low, the increment doesn't happen, we need another assertion. For example:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime));\n\nBut that's more about the active signal's effect. However, since step is involved in the increment only when active and tick are high, maybe it's part of the step's functionality to ensure that when active is low, step isn't used. But the user's instruction is to generate SVAs for the step signal. So perhaps the main ones are:\n\n- Width check.\n- When active and tick, mtime_d increments by step.\n- When not active, even if tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step.\n\nBut how to express the third. For example:\n\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (!active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime));\n\nBut that's checking that when active is low and tick is high, mtime doesn't change. But the step isn't involved here. However, since step is part of the increment, this assertion would indirectly check that step isn't affecting mtime_d when active is low. But maybe this is part of the connectivity for the active signal. Since the user asked for step's SVAs, perhaps the main ones are the width and the active/tick case.\n\nAnother point: the step value should be non-zero when the tick occurs. But the spec allows step to be zero. For example, if step is zero, then mtime doesn't increment even on a tick. The description says \"Allows flexibility in how quickly the timer counts up. Supports fine or coarse time control based on the step size set by firmware.\" So step can be zero. So no assertion about step being non-zero.\n\nSo the final SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check step is 8 bits.\n2. Functionality/connectivity: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3. Also, check that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't increment by step. But how? For example, if active is low and tick is high, mtime_d should be mtime (since the step isn't added). But this is more about the active signal's control over the increment. However, since step is the signal in question, ensuring that it's only used when active is high is part of its functionality.\n\nSo including that assertion would be beneficial. So:\n\nproperty step_increment;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step));\nendproperty\nassert property (step_increment);\n\nproperty no_increment_when_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_increment_when_inactive);\n\nBut the second assertion is more about the active signal, but it's related to step because it ensures that step isn't affecting mtime_d when inactive. However, the user's instruction is to generate SVAs for the step signal. So maybe the second assertion is not strictly necessary for step, but it's part of the functionality that step only affects mtime_d when active and tick. But since the user wants SVAs for step, perhaps the main ones are the width and the active/tick increment.\n\nAnother consideration: the step is an input, so it should be properly connected and not have X or Z values. But that's more of a simulation check and might not be covered by SVA unless specified. The user didn't mention that, so maybe skip it.\n\nSo the final answer would include:\n\n- Width check for step being 8 bits.\n- Assertion that when active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n- Possibly an assertion that when active is low, mtime_d doesn't change, but that's more about active.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to generate SVAs for the step signal. So the key ones are the width and the increment when active and tick. The other assertion (no increment when inactive) is more about the active signal, but since step is part of the increment, maybe it's included.\n\nAlternatively, the user might consider that the step's effect is only when active and tick, so the main assertion is the increment. The inactive case is covered by another SVA for active.\n\nBut given the user's request, I'll include the width, the increment when active and tick, and maybe check that step is stable when tick is high. But the spec doesn't mention that, so maybe not.\n\nSo the final SVAs are:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. Assertion that when active and tick, mtime_d increments by step.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: Ensure `step` is 8 bits wide.\n2. **Connectivity Check**: Verify `step` propagates to `mtime_d` only when `tick` occurs and module is active.\n3. **Functionality Check**: Validate `mtime_d` increments by `step` on active tick, and no increment when inactive.\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct bit-width check using `$bits`.\n- **Connectivity**: Check `mtime_d` updates with `step` only when `tick` and `active` are high.\n- **Functionality**: Ensure correct increment behavior under active/inactive conditions.\n\n[Answer]\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) ($bits(step) == 8));\n\n// Connectivity: step propagates to mtime_d when tick occurs and active\nproperty step_connectivity;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step));\nendproperty\nassert property (step_connectivity);\n\n// Functionality: No mtime increment when inactive (step has no effect)\nproperty step_functionality_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime);\nendproperty\nassert property (step_functionality_inactive);\n```": []

        "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle generating SVAs for the 'step' signal. First, I need to recall the requirements. The user wants assertions that cover width, connectivity, and functionality. Also, they mentioned not to create new signals and stick strictly to the given spec.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. The spec says 'step' is 8-bit. So, I need an assertion that checks the width of 'step' using $bits. That's straightforward: assert that $bits(step) == 8. But wait, in Verilog, the signal might be declared as a reg or wire with a specific width. But the SVA just needs to check the bit width. So the width assertion is covered here.\n\nNext, connectivity. The 'step' is connected to the tick generator and affects mtime. The description says when a tick occurs, mtime increments by step. So connectivity-wise, I need to check that when there's a tick, the next mtime (mtime_d) is current mtime plus step. But wait, the workflow mentions that when a tick is received, the mux selects either step or zero. Wait, the workflow says: \"When a tick is received, a multiplexer selects either the step value or zero.\" Hmm, so maybe the step is added only when there's a tick. So the connectivity here is that when tick is high, mtime_d should be mtime + step. But how is the mux controlled? The description says the mux selects step or zero. So perhaps when tick is active, step is added; otherwise, no increment. So the connectivity assertion would check that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. But the user provided 'tick' as an output. Wait, in the signal list, 'tick' is an output. So the assertion would be: when tick is high, then mtime_d should be mtime + step. But also, when tick is low, mtime_d should remain the same. Wait, but the workflow says the mux selects step or zero. Wait, maybe the adder adds either step or zero. So mtime_d = mtime + (tick ? step : 0). So the connectivity assertion would check that whenever there's a tick, the next mtime is incremented by step. So the property would be: if tick is high, then mtime_d == mtime + step. But how to capture that in SVA? Since mtime_d is the next value, perhaps using a property that checks that at the posedge of clk_i, if tick is high, then mtime_d should be mtime + step. But wait, the tick is generated by the tick generator, which is based on the prescaler. So the tick is an output that pulses when the prescaler counter hits the value. So when tick is high, the step is added. So the connectivity assertion would be that when tick is high, the mtime_d is correctly incremented by step. That's one connectivity check.\n\nAnother connectivity aspect: step is connected to the tick generator. But the tick generator's main function is to generate the tick based on the prescaler. The step is used in the mtime increment, not directly in the tick generation. So maybe the connectivity here is between step and mtime_d via the tick. So the main connectivity is that step affects mtime_d when tick is active.\n\nFor functionality, the step should be an 8-bit value, and when the tick occurs, mtime increments by step. Also, the step should not be zero unless intended, but the spec allows firmware to set it. However, the spec says step is 8-bit, so possible values are 0 to 255. But the functionality assertion would check that whenever a tick occurs, the mtime increments by step. Wait, that's similar to the connectivity check. Maybe the functionality is covered in that assertion. But perhaps there's more. For example, when the module is not active, step might not affect mtime. But the spec says the module assumes the clock is always on, and active is a module active signal. So when active is low, maybe the module is disabled. So the functionality assertion should consider the active signal. Wait, the 'active' signal is an input that activates the module. So when active is low, the module might not function. So the increment should only happen when active is high. So the assertion should check that when active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d is mtime + step. If active is low, even if tick is high, mtime_d should not change. But the spec says \"the timer doesnâ€™t consider low-power modes and assumes the clock is neither turned off nor changed during runtime.\" Hmm, but the 'active' signal is part of the inputs. So maybe when active is low, the module is inactive, so the mtime doesn't increment. So the functionality assertion should include the active signal. So the property would be: if active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d is mtime + step. If active is low, even with tick, no increment. So that's a functionality check.\n\nAlso, the step value should be stable when the tick occurs. Because if step changes at the same time as the tick, the increment might use the old or new value. But the spec doesn't mention this, so maybe it's assumed that step is stable when the tick occurs. But since step is a configuration register, perhaps it's set by firmware and should be stable. So maybe an assertion that when a tick occurs, step doesn't change. But that's not specified. The user might not have provided that info, so maybe skip it.\n\nAnother functionality aspect: after a reset, step should have a default value. But the spec doesn't mention a reset value, so maybe that's not required. The SVA can check that upon reset deassertion, step is within 8 bits, but the width assertion already covers that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that step is 8 bits.\n\nConnectivity: When tick is high and active is high, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n\nFunctionality: Same as connectivity, but also considering that when active is low, even with tick, mtime_d doesn't change.

So when tick is high, add step; when tick is low, add zero. So mtime_d should be mtime + (tick ? step : 0). So two assertions: one for when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step; when tick is low, mtime_d is mtime. But the user's related signals include 'tick', so these are valid.\n\nBut the user's description says \"When a tick is generated, the mtime register is incremented by the step value.\" So the increment only happens on a tick.

Wait, perhaps the adder always adds either step (when tick) or zero (when no tick). So mtime_d is always mtime + (tick ? step : 0). Therefore, when tick is low, mtime_d should be mtime + 0, i.e., mtime. So two connectivity assertions: one for tick high, one for tick low.\n\nBut the user's problem is to generate SVAs for 'step', so the step is only involved when tick is high. When tick is low, step isn't used. So the connectivity for step is only relevant when tick is high. Therefore, the main assertion is that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step.

So the assertion would be: if active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d == mtime + step. If active is low, even with tick high, mtime_d should not change. So that's a functionality check.\n\nAnother point: the step value should not cause mtime to overflow beyond 64 bits. But the spec doesn't mention handling overflow, so perhaps the SVA doesn't need to check that. The mtime is 64-bit, and step is 8-bit, so adding them would wrap around, which is acceptable unless specified otherwise. So no assertion for that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check step is 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity: When active and tick, mtime_d is mtime + step.\n3.

The other assertion (no increment when inactive) is more about the active signal, but since step is part of the increment, maybe it's included.\n\nAlternatively, the user might consider that the step's effect is only when active and tick, so the main assertion is the increment. The inactive case is covered by another SVA for active.\n\nBut given the user's request, I'll include the width, the increment when active and tick, and maybe check that step is stable when tick is high. But the spec doesn't mention that, so maybe not.\n\nSo the final SVAs are:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. Assertion that when active and tick, mtime_d increments by step.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: Ensure `step` is 8 bits wide.\n2. **Connectivity Check**: Verify `step` propagates to `mtime_d` only when `tick` occurs and module is active.\n3. **Functionality Check**: Validate `mtime_d` increments by `step` on active tick, and no increment when inactive.\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct bit-width check using `$bits`.\n- **Connectivity**: Check `mtime_d` updates with `step` only when `tick` and `active` are high.\n- **Functionality**: Ensure correct increment behavior under active/inactive conditions.\n\n[Answer]\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) ($bits(step) == 8));\n\n// Connectivity: step propagates to mtime_d when tick occurs and active\nproperty step_connectivity;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step));\nendproperty\nassert property (step_connectivity);\n\n// Functionality: No mtime increment when inactive (step has no effect)\nproperty step_functionality_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  (!active) |-> (mtime_d == mtime);\nendproperty\nassert property (step_functionality_inactive);\n```": 50.0
