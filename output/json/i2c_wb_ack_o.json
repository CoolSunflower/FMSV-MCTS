        "<think>\n\nOkay, let's analyze the provided SVAs for `wb_ack_o` based on the specifications and the user's feedback request. I need to check for correctness, consistency, completeness, and potential flaws. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**:\n   - **Provided**: `assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);`\n   - **Analysis**: Correct. Ensures `wb_ack_o` is strictly 1-bit. No issues here.\n\n2. **Ack After Request**:\n   - **Provided**: Uses `|=>` to check `wb_ack_o` asserts one cycle after `wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i`.\n   - **Flaw**: The specification states **each access takes 2 clock cycles**, but the assertion assumes `wb_ack_o` asserts **immediately** after the request (next cycle). However, in WISHBONE Classic, `wb_ack_o` typically asserts in the **second cycle** of a 2-cycle access. The assertion is correct if the core asserts `wb_ack_o` on the next cycle after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high. But if the access spans two cycles (address phase → data phase), the assertion is valid. No explicit flaw here, but depends on the core’s exact timing.\n\n3. **Ack Only With cyc_i**:\n   - **Provided**: Checks `wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i`.\n   - **Flaw**: Correct per WISHBONE rules. However, it misses checking `wb_stb_i`. While `wb_cyc_i` must be high during `wb_ack_o`, `wb_stb_i` might be low in the data phase (second cycle). The assertion is still compliant because WISHBONE only requires `wb_cyc_i` during `wb_ack_o`. No flaw here.\n\n4. **Ack One Cycle**:\n   - **Provided**: Ensures `wb_ack_o` deasserts after one cycle.\n   - **Flaw**: Correct for single transfers. However, if back-to-back requests occur (e.g., `wb_stb_i` stays high), `wb_ack_o` could assert again immediately. The assertion would fail in this case. The property should allow `wb_ack_o` to stay high if a new request is present. **Flaw: Does not account for consecutive transactions**.\n\n5. **Ack During Reset**:\n   - **Provided**: Checks `(arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o`.\n   - **Flaw**: Asynchronous reset (`arst_i`) can occur at any time, but the assertion only checks at clock edges. If `arst_i` asserts asynchronously, `wb_ack_o` might glitch between clock edges. The assertion cannot catch this. **Flaw: Incomplete reset coverage for asynchronous resets**.\n\n6. **Missing Assertions**:\n   - **No Check for Spurious Acks**: There’s no assertion to ensure `wb_ack_o` never asserts without a prior `wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i`.\n   - **No Check for Data Validity**: When `wb_ack_o` is high during a read, `wb_dat_o` should be valid. This is not verified.\n   - **No Multi-Master Arbitration Check**: While not directly related to `wb_ack_o`, the core’s arbitration loss (`AL` bit) should cancel transactions, but this isn’t linked to `wb_ack_o` behavior.\n\n7. **Clock Cycle Misinterpretations**:\n   - The assertion `ack_after_request` uses `|=>`, which implies a 1-cycle delay. If the core’s 2-cycle access includes the cycle where `wb_stb_i` is high as the first cycle and `wb_ack_o` in the second, this is correct. However, if the core has additional pipeline stages, this might not hold. The spec is unclear on exact timing, but the provided assertion aligns with the description.\n\n8. **Nested Conditions**:\n   - The properties use simple implications. No nested conditions, so no issue here.\n\n**Score Calculation**:\n- **Correctness**: 80/100 (Fails to handle back-to-back transactions and asynchronous reset glitches).\n- **Consistency**: 90/100 (Mostly aligns with WISHBONE rules but misses `wb_stb_i` in some checks).\n- **Completeness**: 70/100 (Missing checks for spurious acks, data validity, and reset glitches).\n\n**Final Score**: **75/100**\n\n**Critical Feedback**:\n1. **Back-to-Back Transactions**: The `ack_one_cycle` assertion is too restrictive. It should allow `wb_ack_o` to assert again if a new request occurs immediately.  \n   **Fix**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property ack_one_cycle;\n     @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n     wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\n   endproperty\n   ```\n\n2. **Asynchronous Reset Glitches**: The reset assertion only checks at clock edges. Use `async_arst` check if possible (though SVAs are synchronous).  \n   **Fix**: Add a concurrent `always` check (outside SVA) for asynchronous reset:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   always @(posedge arst_i) if (arst_i == ARST_LVL) assert (!wb_ack_o);\n   ```\n\n3. **Spurious Acks**: Add an assertion to ensure `wb_ack_o` only follows valid requests:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property no_spurious_ack;\n     @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n     wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\n   endproperty\n   assert property (no_spurious_ack);\n   ```\n\n4. **Data Validity**: For read cycles, ensure `wb_dat_o` is stable when `wb_ack_o` is high:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property data_valid_on_ack;\n     @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n     (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\n   endproperty\n   assert property (data_valid_on_ack);\n   ```\n\n**Conclusion**: The SVAs are mostly correct but lack coverage for edge cases like back-to-back transactions, asynchronous reset glitches, and data validity. Addressing these gaps would improve robustness.\n</think>\n\n**Feedback on SVAs for `wb_ack_o`**  \n**Score: 75/100**  \n\n### **Flaws and Improvements**  \n1. **Back-to-Back Transactions** (Score Impact: **-10**)  \n   - **Issue**: The `ack_one_cycle` assertion forces `wb_ack_o` to deassert unconditionally, failing for consecutive transactions.  \n   - **Fix**: Allow `wb_ack_o` to re-assert if a new request occurs:  \n     ```systemverilog\n     property ack_one_cycle;\n       @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n       wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\n     endproperty\n     ```\n\n2. **Asynchronous Reset Glitches** (Score Impact: **-10**)  \n   - **Issue**: The reset assertion only checks at clock edges, missing asynchronous glitches.  \n   - **Fix**: Add a concurrent check (outside SVA):  \n     ```systemverilog\n     always @(posedge arst_i) if (arst_i == ARST_LVL) assert (!wb_ack_o);\n     ```\n\n3. **Spurious Acks** (Score Impact: **-5**)  \n   - **Issue**: No check for `wb_ack_o` without prior `wb_stb_i`/`wb_cyc_i`.  \n   - **Fix**: Add:  \n     ```systemverilog\n     property no_spurious_ack;\n       @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n       wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\n     endproperty\n     ```\n\n4. **Data Validity** (Score Impact: **-5**)  \n   - **Issue**: No check for valid `wb_dat_o` during read `wb_ack_o`.  \n   - **Fix**: Add:  \n     ```systemverilog\n     property data_valid_on_ack;\n       @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n       (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\n     endproperty\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### **Final Score Justification**  \n- **Correctness**: 80/100  \n- **Consistency**: 90/100  \n- **Completeness**: 70/100  \n\n**Key Strengths**:  \n- Correct width and basic timing checks.  \n- Adheres to WISHBONE’s `wb_cyc_i` rule.  \n\n**Critical Weaknesses**:  \n- Fails to handle back-to-back transactions.  \n- Incomplete reset and data validity checks.  \n\n**Recommendation**: Address the missing edge cases and asynchronous reset behavior to achieve **95/100**.",
        "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the feedback for the generated SVAs for `wb_ack_o` based on the specifications and the user's strict requirements. The goal is to identify every possible flaw, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, clock cycle misinterpretations, nested conditions, and long expressions. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### **1. Width Assertion**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Correct. Ensures `wb_ack_o` is 1-bit as per spec.\n- **Consistency**: Aligns with the signal definition.\n- **Completeness**: None. No issues here.\n\n**Score**: +100 (No flaws).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Connectivity: `ack_after_request`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Partially correct. The assertion enforces that `wb_ack_o` asserts **exactly** one cycle after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high. However, the WISHBONE spec allows for variable latency (ack can come after **any** number of cycles as long as `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` remain asserted). The current assertion assumes fixed 2-cycle latency, which is **not** universally true for all WISHBONE implementations.\n- **Consistency**: Violates WISHBONE flexibility. The core’s spec says \"each access takes 2 clock cycles,\" so this is acceptable, but the assertion should explicitly check for **exactly** 2 cycles.\n- **Completeness**: Missing check for `wb_ack_o` **only** after a valid request. The current code allows `wb_ack_o` to assert even if `wb_stb_i` or `wb_cyc_i` drop before the next cycle (e.g., if the master aborts the request).\n\n**Score**: -20 (Assumes fixed latency, misses abort cases).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Connectivity: `ack_with_cyc`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Correct. WISHBONE mandates that `wb_ack_o` is only valid during an active cycle (`wb_cyc_i` high).\n- **Consistency**: Aligns with spec.\n- **Completeness**: None. Well-formed.\n\n**Score**: +100 (No flaws).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Functionality: `no_spurious_ack`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Partially correct. Checks that `wb_ack_o` follows a request from the previous cycle. However, it does not account for multi-cycle requests where `wb_stb_i`/`wb_cyc_i` might stay high for multiple cycles (e.g., pipelined transactions). The assertion would falsely flag valid acks in such cases.\n- **Consistency**: Incorrect for multi-master or pipelined scenarios. The core’s spec does not mention pipelining, so this is acceptable if the core only supports single-cycle requests.\n- **Completeness**: Misses cases where `wb_stb_i`/`wb_cyc_i` are held high for multiple cycles. The assertion assumes one request per ack, which may not hold.\n\n**Score**: -10 (Fails for multi-cycle requests).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Functionality: `ack_one_cycle`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Flawed. The `throughout` operator checks that `!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i)` holds **continuously** from the next cycle onward, which is overly restrictive. The intent was to allow `wb_ack_o` to stay high if a new request occurs, but the logic is inverted. The correct approach is:\n  ```systemverilog\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o || (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\n  ```\n- **Consistency**: Misuses `throughout`, leading to false failures. For example, if `wb_stb_i`/`wb_cyc_i` toggle after `wb_ack_o`, the assertion fails unnecessarily.\n- **Completeness**: Does not properly handle back-to-back requests. The current code forces `wb_ack_o` to deassert even if a new request is present.\n\n**Score**: -30 (Incorrect use of `throughout`, logic inversion).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Functionality: `ack_reset`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Partially correct. Checks synchronous reset but **ignores asynchronous reset** (`arst_i`). Asynchronous reset can occur at any time (not just clock edges), so this assertion misses cases where `arst_i` is asserted between clock edges, leaving `wb_ack_o` undetected.\n- **Consistency**: Fails to cover asynchronous reset fully. The `disable iff` clause in other properties handles resets, but this assertion only checks at clock edges.\n- **Completeness**: Needs an additional check using `$inferred_clock` or combinational logic for asynchronous resets, which is not feasible in SVAs. Alternative: Use `always @(arst_i or wb_rst_i) assert (!wb_ack_o);` but this is not synthesizable.\n\n**Score**: -15 (Misses asynchronous reset edge cases).\n\n---\n\n### **7. Functionality: `data_valid_on_ack`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Correct. Ensures `wb_dat_o` is stable during read acks.\n- **Consistency**: Aligns with spec’s note that \"output signals are registered.\"\n- **Completeness**: None. Well-formed.\n\n**Score**: +100 (No flaws).\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Flaws**\n1. **Clock Cycle Misinterpretations**:\n   - `ack_after_request` assumes fixed 2-cycle latency. If the core ever takes >1 cycle to respond (e.g., due to clock stretching), this assertion fails. The spec says \"each access takes 2 clock cycles,\" so this is acceptable but should be explicitly noted.\n   \n2. **Nested Conditions**:\n   - `arst_i == ARST_LVL` is repeated in every `disable iff`. This could be error-prone if `ARST_LVL` is redefined. Better to use a macro or parameter.\n\n3. **Missing Checks**:\n   - No assertion ensures `wb_ack_o` is **only** asserted for one cycle per request. A burst of acks could occur if the core malfunctions.\n   - No check for `wb_ack_o` during write cycles (e.g., `wb_we_i` high). The spec does not differentiate read/write for acks, but this could be an oversight.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Score**\n- **Correctness**: 70/100 (Flaws in latency, reset, and ack duration).\n- **Consistency**: 80/100 (Mostly aligns with spec but misses edge cases).\n- **Completeness**: 60/100 (Missing multi-cycle request handling, burst ack checks).\n- **Total**: **60/100** (Needs fixes for reset, ack duration, and multi-cycle cases).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. Fix `ack_one_cycle` using `|=> !wb_ack_o || (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i)`.\n2. Replace `ack_after_request` with a check for **exactly** 2-cycle latency if the spec mandates it.\n3. Add an assertion to prevent multiple acks per request.\n4. Use `always_comb` for asynchronous reset checks (non-SVA) if possible.\n5.

        "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at the SVAs provided for wb_ack_o. The user wants me to critique them strictly, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, and clock cycle misinterpretations. Let's go through each assertion one by one.\n\nFirst, the \"ack_after_request\" property. It checks that after a valid request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i high), wb_ack_o asserts in the next cycle. But wait, the specification says each access takes two clock cycles. So the ack should come two cycles after the request, not one. This is a major flaw. The current assertion would fail because it's expecting the ack too early. That's a clock cycle misinterpretation.\n\nNext, \"ack_only_with_cyc\" ensures that ack is only high when cyc_i is active. That seems correct according to WISHBONE rules. But does it account for the possibility that cyc_i might drop in the same cycle as ack? The standard allows cyc_i to drop when ack is received, so maybe the assertion should check that cyc_i was active in the previous cycle when ack is asserted. Otherwise, there might be a false failure if cyc_i and ack drop simultaneously.\n\nThe \"no_spurious_ack\" property uses $past to check that a valid request occurred in the previous cycle. But if the request is sustained over multiple cycles, does this assertion handle that? Also, the specification mentions that each access takes two cycles. So the ack should come two cycles after the request, not one. This assertion is checking the wrong timing, similar to the first one. It's using $past(...,1) which is one cycle, but it should be two cycles. This is another clock cycle error.\n\nThen there's \"ack_deassert_unless_new_req\". The property says that if ack is high, then in the next cycle it should stay high only if there's a new request. But the way it's written might not handle back-to-back transactions correctly. Also, the syntax \"wb_ack_o |=> (wb_ack_o ? ...)\" could be simplified. Moreover, the specification says that each access takes two cycles, so consecutive acks might not be possible unless there's a pipelined request. The current assertion might not align with the two-cycle access rule, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nThe \"ack_reset\" property checks that during reset, ack is low. But the reset could be asynchronous (arst_i) or synchronous (wb_rst_i). The current assertion covers both, which is good. However, it doesn't check that ack remains low for the duration of the reset. If the reset is deasserted but then reasserted, does the assertion hold? Also, after reset deassertion, there might be a race condition if a request is made immediately. The assertion only checks the reset condition at the posedge, which is correct, but maybe there's a need to ensure that ack doesn't glitch during reset transitions.\n\nOther issues: The SVAs don't check the relationship between ack and the data signals (wb_dat_i, wb_dat_o). The specification mentions that all outputs are registered, so when ack is high, the data from the core (wb_dat_o) should be valid. There's no assertion ensuring that wb_dat_o is stable when ack is high. This is a completeness issue.\n\nAlso, the specification says that the core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with 2-cycle accesses. The current assertions don't verify that the ack occurs exactly two cycles after the request. They assume one cycle, which is incorrect. This is a major correctness issue across multiple properties.\n\nAnother point: The \"ack_deassert_unless_new_req\" property uses a ternary operator which might not be the clearest way to express the condition. It could be split into two separate properties for clarity. Additionally, the property might not handle the case where a new request starts in the same cycle as the ack is deasserting. There's a potential for overlapping transactions that aren't accounted for.\n\nLastly, there's no check for the maximum duration of ack. According to the spec, each access is two cycles, so ack should be high for exactly one cycle per request. The current assertions don't ensure that ack doesn't stay high longer than necessary, leading to possible protocol violations.\n\nIn summary, the main flaws are:\n1. Incorrect timing (1 cycle vs 2 cycles for ack).\n2. Missing checks for data validity with ack.\n3. Potential issues with back-to-back transactions and ack deassertion.\n4. No handling of the exact two-cycle access requirement.\n5. Possible oversights in reset behavior and signal stability.\n</think>\n\n**Critical Feedback on SVAs for `wb_ack_o`**  \n**Score: -65/100**  \n\n### **1. Clock Cycle Misinterpretation (Severe)**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **All assertions assume 1-cycle latency** between `wb_stb_i/wb_cyc_i` and `wb_ack_o`, but the specification explicitly states **2 clock cycles per access** (Section 2.2: \"Each access takes 2 clock cycles\").  \n  - Example: `ack_after_request` uses `|=>` (1-cycle delay), but it should use `|=> ##1 wb_ack_o`.  \n  - **Impact**: All timing-related assertions are fundamentally incorrect.  \n\n### **2. Incomplete Protocol Compliance**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **Missing check for `wb_ack_o` duration**: The spec requires `wb_ack_o` to pulse for **exactly 1 cycle per transaction**. No assertion ensures it doesn’t stay asserted for multiple cycles.  \n- **No data validity check**: When `wb_ack_o` is high, `wb_dat_o` (for reads) must be stable. Missing assertion:  \n  ```systemverilog\n  assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o));  \n  ```  \n\n### **3. Weak Reset Handling**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **Ignores asynchronous reset glitches**: The `ack_reset` property checks reset at the clock edge but doesn’t ensure `wb_ack_o` stays low **throughout** reset (e.g., during asynchronous reset transitions).  \n- **No recovery check**: Missing assertion to ensure `wb_ack_o` doesn’t assert prematurely after reset deassertion.  \n\n### **4. Back-to-Back Transaction Issues**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **`ack_deassert_unless_new_req` is ambiguous**:  \n  - Fails to account for the **2-cycle access rule** for consecutive transactions.  \n  - Incorrectly uses ternary operator (`wb_ack_o ? ...`), which doesn’t enforce strict deassertion after one cycle. Replace with:  \n    ```systemverilog\n    wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o // Must deassert after 1 cycle  \n    ```  \n\n### **5. Spurious Ack Check Incompleteness**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **`no_spurious_ack` uses `$past(...,1)`**: This assumes a 1-cycle request-to-ack latency, which violates the spec’s 2-cycle requirement. Correct version:  \n  ```systemverilog\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 2)  \n  ```  \n\n### **6. WISHBONE Rule Violations**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **`ack_only_with_cyc` is too lenient**: It allows `wb_ack_o` to assert if `wb_cyc_i` drops in the same cycle (violates WISHBONE RevB.3). Strengthen with:  \n  ```systemverilog\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_cyc_i, 1)  \n  ```  \n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**  \n1. **Fix 2-Cycle Access Timing**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property ack_after_request;  \n     @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)  \n     (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;  \n   endproperty  \n   ```  \n2. **Add Data Stability Assertion**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o));  \n   ```  \n3. **Strengthen Reset Checks**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property ack_reset_holds;  \n     @(posedge wb_clk_i)  \n     (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> ##[0:$] !wb_ack_o;  \n   endproperty  \n   ```  \n4. **Enforce 1-Cycle Ack Pulse**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $rose(wb_ack_o) |=> $fell(wb_ack_o));  \n   ```  \n\n**Final Score Adjustment**: **+35** after fixes."

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit. Use `$bits` to verify.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - WISHBONE requires `wb_ack_o` to assert **exactly one cycle** after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high (2-cycle access).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only be high when `wb_cyc_i` is active (WISHBONE rule).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_ack_o` must **never** assert during reset (sync or async).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must deassert after one cycle unless a new request occurs.\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only follow valid requests (no spurious acks).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check with `$bits`.\n- **Timing**: Use overlapping implication to ensure ack follows request.\n- **Reset**: Check ack is low during reset.\n- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure ack aligns with WISHBONE standards.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// Functionality: Ack only when cyc_i is active\nproperty ack_only_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_with_cyc);\n\n// Functionality: Ack deasserts after one cycle\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// Reset condition: Ack never asserted during reset\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n```",
        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specifications and the feedback from the previous attempt. Let's start by reviewing the requirements and the issues identified in the prior version.\n\nFirst, the width assertion is straightforward—wb_ack_o is a 1-bit signal, so checking its width is essential. That part is correct and doesn't need changes.\n\nNext, connectivity. The previous assertion checked that wb_ack_o asserts one cycle after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high. The feedback mentioned that this might not account for back-to-back transactions. However, according to the WISHBONE spec, each access takes two cycles, so the ack should come exactly one cycle after the request. The original assertion is correct, but the feedback suggested that the ack_one_cycle assertion was too restrictive. The fix was to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present. So I need to adjust the ack_one_cycle property to handle consecutive transactions.\n\nThen, the functionality checks. The previous version missed checking for spurious acks (ack without a prior request) and data validity during read operations. Also, the reset check didn't account for asynchronous resets properly.\n\nFor the reset condition, the original assertion checked that during reset, ack is low. However, asynchronous resets can occur at any time, not just clock edges. The feedback suggested adding an always block to check asynchronous resets, but SVAs are synchronous. So perhaps using a concurrent assertion with $inferred_clock might help, but it's tricky. Alternatively, rely on the disable iff clause to handle resets.\n\nThe data validity check for reads wasn't in the original SVAs. The user's specification mentions that wb_dat_o is valid when ack is high during a read, so adding that is necessary.\n\nPutting this all together, here's the plan:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: Keep as is.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - Ack asserts one cycle after request.\n   - Ack only when cyc_i is active.\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - Ack deasserts after one cycle unless a new request starts.\n   - No ack during reset (sync or async).\n   - No spurious acks (ack only after request).\n   - Data validity during read acks.\n\nNow, implementing these with the fixes from the feedback:\n\n- For back-to-back transactions, modify the ack_one_cycle property to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present.\n- Add a spurious ack check using $past.\n- Add data validity check for reads.\n- Ensure reset checks cover both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.\n\nTesting for syntax and correctness, ensuring no new signals are introduced and all assertions align with the spec.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] Check signal width using $bits\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request (WISHBONE 2-cycle rule)\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i is active (WISHBONE protocol)\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\n// [Functionality] No spurious acks (ack only after valid request)\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_spurious_ack);\n\n// [Functionality] Ack duration (1 cycle unless back-to-back request)\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset condition (sync/async)\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\n// [Functionality] Data validity during read acks\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (data_valid_on_ack);\n```",
        "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle generating the SVAs for `wb_ack_o` again, incorporating the feedback and ensuring all syntax and semantic issues are addressed. \n\nFirst, I'll start by revisiting the specifications and the previous errors. The main issues were around the `ack_one_cycle` property misusing `throughout`, the reset condition not handling asynchronous resets properly, and missing checks for multi-cycle requests and burst acks.\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: Straightforward, no changes needed here.\n2. **Connectivity - Ack Timing**: The spec says each access takes 2 cycles, so the ack should come exactly one cycle after the request. The original `ack_after_request` used `|=>`, which is correct, but to be explicit, using `##1` ensures the 2-cycle latency.\n3. **No Spurious Acks**: The previous check used `$past`, which works for single-cycle requests. For multi-cycle, adding `throughout wb_cyc_i[*1:$]` ensures the request was active at least once in the past cycles.\n4. **Ack Duration**: The corrected `ack_one_cycle` now allows ack to persist if a new request is present, using logical OR.\n5. **Reset Handling**: Split into synchronous and asynchronous checks. The synchronous part uses `disable iff`, and an `always` block handles async resets (though non-synthesizable, it's a simulation check).\n6. **Data Validity**: Already correct, no changes.\n7. **Single Ack Per Request**: Added a new assertion to prevent multiple acks per request using `|-> ##[1:2] wb_ack_o [->1]`.\n\nI also need to ensure all assertions are segregated into width, connectivity, and functionality sections as per the user's latest instruction. Let me organize them accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] Check signal width using $bits\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts exactly 2 cycles after valid request\nproperty ack_timing;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only during active bus cycles\nproperty ack_bus_relationship;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_bus_relationship);\n\n// [Functionality] No ack during resets\nproperty ack_reset_protection;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset_protection);\n\n// [Functionality] Valid data on read acknowledgements\nproperty ack_data_validity;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_data_validity);\n\n// [Functionality] Single ack per request\nproperty single_ack_guarantee;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> ##[1:2] wb_ack_o [->1];\nendproperty\nassert property (single_ack_guarantee);\n\n// [Functionality] Ack persistence rule for back-to-back requests\nproperty ack_persistence_rule;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o || (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_persistence_rule);\n``` \n\n**Verification:**\n1.

        "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `wb_ack_o` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. First, I need to recall the key points from the specification and the feedback given.\n\nFrom the specification, `wb_ack_o` is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a completed bus cycle. Each access takes two clock cycles. The previous feedback highlighted issues with timing (using 1 cycle instead of 2), missing data validity checks, and incomplete reset handling.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. Since `wb_ack_o` is defined as 1-bit, a simple check using `$bits` is needed. However, in SystemVerilog, `$bits` is a compile-time function, so a static assertion isn't necessary. But to be thorough, maybe include a comment about the width, though it's not a runtime check.\n\nNext, connectivity. The WISHBONE interface requires that `wb_ack_o` asserts exactly two cycles after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are both high. The previous assertion used `|=>`, which is a one-cycle delay, but the correct delay is two cycles. So, the property should use `##1` to add another cycle, making it `|=> ##1 wb_ack_o`.\n\nFor functionality, ensuring that `wb_ack_o` is only high for one cycle per transaction is crucial. The previous attempt had a property that tried to handle deassertion but used a ternary operator, which was confusing. A better approach is to assert that once `wb_ack_o` rises, it must fall on the next cycle, ensuring a single-cycle pulse.\n\nAnother functionality point is checking that `wb_ack_o` only follows a valid request. The original assertion used `$past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1)`, but since the ack comes two cycles later, it should be `$past(..., 2)` instead.\n\nReset handling needs to ensure that during any reset (asynchronous or synchronous), `wb_ack_o` remains low. Also, after reset, the signal shouldn't glitch. The assertion should check that whenever reset is active, `wb_ack_o` is low, not just at the clock edge but throughout the reset period.\n\nData validity is another aspect. When `wb_ack_o` is high, the data on `wb_dat_o` should be valid and stable. An assertion should check that `wb_dat_o` isn't unknown (X or Z) when `wb_ack_o` is high.\n\nBack-to-back transactions need consideration. If a new request starts immediately after an ack, the two-cycle rule still applies. The ack from the first transaction should deassert, and the new ack should come two cycles after the new request.\n\nPutting this all together, the SVAs should cover:\n\n1. Correct two-cycle delay from request to ack.\n2. Ack only when `wb_cyc_i` was active in the previous cycle.\n3. No spurious acks without a prior request.\n4. Ack deasserts after one cycle.\n5. Reset conditions keep ack low.\n6. Data validity when ack is high.\n\nEach of these points translates into specific properties. Now, structuring them properly while avoiding syntax errors and adhering to the spec is key. Also, ensuring that all feedback points are addressed, especially the timing correction from one cycle to two cycles.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] - Static check (wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit)\n// No runtime assertion needed for fixed-width signals\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts exactly 2 cycles after valid request\nproperty ack_timing;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i was active in previous cycle\nproperty ack_cyc_relationship;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_cyc_relationship);\n\n// [Functionality] Single-cycle ack pulse\nproperty ack_pulse_width;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  $rose(wb_ack_o) |=> $fell(wb_ack_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_pulse_width);\n\n// [Functionality] Valid data with ack\nproperty ack_data_valid;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_data_valid);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset clears ack persistently\nproperty ack_reset_behavior;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> ##[0:$] !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset_behavior);\n\n// [Functionality] No ack without prior request\nproperty ack_causality;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 2);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_causality);\n``` \n\n**Key Improvements from Feedback**:\n1. **2-Cycle Timing**: Fixed with `|=> ##1` to match spec's 2-cycle access\n2. **Data Validity**: Added check for stable `wb_dat_o` during ack\n3. **Reset Robustness**: Used `##[0:$]` to cover entire reset duration\n4. **Protocol Compliance**: Enforced single-cycle ack pulse and WISHBONE cyc_i rules\n5. **Causality Check**: Uses `$past(...,2)` for correct request-ack timing"

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit. Use `$bits` to verify.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - WISHBONE requires `wb_ack_o` to assert **exactly one cycle** after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high (2-cycle access).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only be high when `wb_cyc_i` is active (WISHBONE rule).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_ack_o` must **never** assert during reset (sync or async).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must deassert after one cycle unless a new request occurs.\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only follow valid requests (no spurious acks).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check with `$bits`.\n- **Timing**: Use overlapping implication to ensure ack follows request.\n- **Reset**: Check ack is low during reset.\n- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure ack aligns with WISHBONE standards.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// Functionality: Ack only when cyc_i is active\nproperty ack_only_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_with_cyc);\n\n// Functionality: Ack deasserts after one cycle\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// Reset condition: Ack never asserted during reset\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n```",
        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specifications and the feedback from the previous attempt. Let's start by reviewing the requirements and the issues identified in the prior version.\n\nFirst, the width assertion is straightforward—wb_ack_o is a 1-bit signal, so checking its width is essential. That part is correct and doesn't need changes.\n\nNext, connectivity. The previous assertion checked that wb_ack_o asserts one cycle after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high. The feedback mentioned that this might not account for back-to-back transactions. However, according to the WISHBONE spec, each access takes two cycles, so the ack should come exactly one cycle after the request. The original assertion is correct, but the feedback suggested that the ack_one_cycle assertion was too restrictive. The fix was to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present. So I need to adjust the ack_one_cycle property to handle consecutive transactions.\n\nThen, the functionality checks. The previous version missed checking for spurious acks (ack without a prior request) and data validity during read operations. Also, the reset check didn't account for asynchronous resets properly.\n\nFor the reset condition, the original assertion checked that during reset, ack is low. However, asynchronous resets can occur at any time, not just clock edges. The feedback suggested adding an always block to check asynchronous resets, but SVAs are synchronous. So perhaps using a concurrent assertion with $inferred_clock might help, but it's tricky. Alternatively, rely on the disable iff clause to handle resets.\n\nThe data validity check for reads wasn't in the original SVAs. The user's specification mentions that wb_dat_o is valid when ack is high during a read, so adding that is necessary.\n\nPutting this all together, here's the plan:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: Keep as is.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - Ack asserts one cycle after request.\n   - Ack only when cyc_i is active.\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - Ack deasserts after one cycle unless a new request starts.\n   - No ack during reset (sync or async).\n   - No spurious acks (ack only after request).\n   - Data validity during read acks.\n\nNow, implementing these with the fixes from the feedback:\n\n- For back-to-back transactions, modify the ack_one_cycle property to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present.\n- Add a spurious ack check using $past.\n- Add data validity check for reads.\n- Ensure reset checks cover both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.\n\nTesting for syntax and correctness, ensuring no new signals are introduced and all assertions align with the spec.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] Check signal width using $bits\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request (WISHBONE 2-cycle rule)\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i is active (WISHBONE protocol)\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\n// [Functionality] No spurious acks (ack only after valid request)\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_spurious_ack);\n\n// [Functionality] Ack duration (1 cycle unless back-to-back request)\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset condition (sync/async)\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\n// [Functionality] Data validity during read acks\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (data_valid_on_ack);\n```",
        "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle generating the SVAs for `wb_ack_o` again, incorporating the feedback and ensuring all syntax and semantic issues are addressed. \n\nFirst, I'll start by revisiting the specifications and the previous errors.

The original `ack_after_request` used `|=>`, which is correct, but to be explicit, using `##1` ensures the 2-cycle latency.\n3. **No Spurious Acks**: The previous check used `$past`, which works for single-cycle requests. For multi-cycle, adding `throughout wb_cyc_i[*1:$]` ensures the request was active at least once in the past cycles.\n4. **Ack Duration**: The corrected `ack_one_cycle` now allows ack to persist if a new request is present, using logical OR.\n5. **Reset Handling**: Split into synchronous and asynchronous checks. The synchronous part uses `disable iff`, and an `always` block handles async resets (though non-synthesizable, it's a simulation check).\n6. **Data Validity**: Already correct, no changes.\n7. **Single Ack Per Request**: Added a new assertion to prevent multiple acks per request using `|-> ##[1:2] wb_ack_o [->1]`.\n\nI also need to ensure all assertions are segregated into width, connectivity, and functionality sections as per the user's latest instruction.

        "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `wb_ack_o` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. First, I need to recall the key points from the specification and the feedback given.\n\nFrom the specification, `wb_ack_o` is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a completed bus cycle. Each access takes two clock cycles. The previous feedback highlighted issues with timing (using 1 cycle instead of 2), missing data validity checks, and incomplete reset handling.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. Since `wb_ack_o` is defined as 1-bit, a simple check using `$bits` is needed. However, in SystemVerilog, `$bits` is a compile-time function, so a static assertion isn't necessary. But to be thorough, maybe include a comment about the width, though it's not a runtime check.\n\nNext, connectivity. The WISHBONE interface requires that `wb_ack_o` asserts exactly two cycles after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are both high. The previous assertion used `|=>`, which is a one-cycle delay, but the correct delay is two cycles. So, the property should use `##1` to add another cycle, making it `|=> ##1 wb_ack_o`.\n\nFor functionality, ensuring that `wb_ack_o` is only high for one cycle per transaction is crucial. The previous attempt had a property that tried to handle deassertion but used a ternary operator, which was confusing. A better approach is to assert that once `wb_ack_o` rises, it must fall on the next cycle, ensuring a single-cycle pulse.\n\nAnother functionality point is checking that `wb_ack_o` only follows a valid request. The original assertion used `$past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1)`, but since the ack comes two cycles later, it should be `$past(..., 2)` instead.\n\nReset handling needs to ensure that during any reset (asynchronous or synchronous), `wb_ack_o` remains low. Also, after reset, the signal shouldn't glitch. The assertion should check that whenever reset is active, `wb_ack_o` is low, not just at the clock edge but throughout the reset period.\n\nData validity is another aspect. When `wb_ack_o` is high, the data on `wb_dat_o` should be valid and stable. An assertion should check that `wb_dat_o` isn't unknown (X or Z) when `wb_ack_o` is high.\n\nBack-to-back transactions need consideration. If a new request starts immediately after an ack, the two-cycle rule still applies. The ack from the first transaction should deassert, and the new ack should come two cycles after the new request.\n\nPutting this all together, the SVAs should cover:\n\n1. Correct two-cycle delay from request to ack.\n2. Ack only when `wb_cyc_i` was active in the previous cycle.\n3. No spurious acks without a prior request.\n4. Ack deasserts after one cycle.\n5. Reset conditions keep ack low.\n6. Data validity when ack is high.\n\nEach of these points translates into specific properties. Now, structuring them properly while avoiding syntax errors and adhering to the spec is key. Also, ensuring that all feedback points are addressed, especially the timing correction from one cycle to two cycles.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] - Static check (wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit)\n// No runtime assertion needed for fixed-width signals\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts exactly 2 cycles after valid request\nproperty ack_timing;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i was active in previous cycle\nproperty ack_cyc_relationship;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_cyc_relationship);\n\n// [Functionality] Single-cycle ack pulse\nproperty ack_pulse_width;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  $rose(wb_ack_o) |=> $fell(wb_ack_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_pulse_width);\n\n// [Functionality] Valid data with ack\nproperty ack_data_valid;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_data_valid);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset clears ack persistently\nproperty ack_reset_behavior;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> ##[0:$] !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset_behavior);\n\n// [Functionality] No ack without prior request\nproperty ack_causality;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 2);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_causality);\n``` \n\n**Key Improvements from Feedback**:\n1. **2-Cycle Timing**: Fixed with `|=> ##1` to match spec's 2-cycle access\n2. **Data Validity**: Added check for stable `wb_dat_o` during ack\n3. **Reset Robustness**: Used `##[0:$]` to cover entire reset duration\n4. **Protocol Compliance**: Enforced single-cycle ack pulse and WISHBONE cyc_i rules\n5. **Causality Check**: Uses `$past(...,2)` for correct request-ack timing"

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit. Use `$bits` to verify.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - WISHBONE requires `wb_ack_o` to assert **exactly one cycle** after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high (2-cycle access).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only be high when `wb_cyc_i` is active (WISHBONE rule).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_ack_o` must **never** assert during reset (sync or async).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must deassert after one cycle unless a new request occurs.\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only follow valid requests (no spurious acks).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check with `$bits`.\n- **Timing**: Use overlapping implication to ensure ack follows request.\n- **Reset**: Check ack is low during reset.\n- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure ack aligns with WISHBONE standards.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// Functionality: Ack only when cyc_i is active\nproperty ack_only_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_with_cyc);\n\n// Functionality: Ack deasserts after one cycle\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// Reset condition: Ack never asserted during reset\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n```": [

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specifications and the feedback from the previous attempt. Let's start by reviewing the requirements and the issues identified in the prior version.\n\nFirst, the width assertion is straightforward—wb_ack_o is a 1-bit signal, so checking its width is essential. That part is correct and doesn't need changes.\n\nNext, connectivity. The previous assertion checked that wb_ack_o asserts one cycle after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high. The feedback mentioned that this might not account for back-to-back transactions. However, according to the WISHBONE spec, each access takes two cycles, so the ack should come exactly one cycle after the request. The original assertion is correct, but the feedback suggested that the ack_one_cycle assertion was too restrictive. The fix was to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present. So I need to adjust the ack_one_cycle property to handle consecutive transactions.\n\nThen, the functionality checks. The previous version missed checking for spurious acks (ack without a prior request) and data validity during read operations. Also, the reset check didn't account for asynchronous resets properly.\n\nFor the reset condition, the original assertion checked that during reset, ack is low. However, asynchronous resets can occur at any time, not just clock edges. The feedback suggested adding an always block to check asynchronous resets, but SVAs are synchronous. So perhaps using a concurrent assertion with $inferred_clock might help, but it's tricky. Alternatively, rely on the disable iff clause to handle resets.\n\nThe data validity check for reads wasn't in the original SVAs. The user's specification mentions that wb_dat_o is valid when ack is high during a read, so adding that is necessary.\n\nPutting this all together, here's the plan:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: Keep as is.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - Ack asserts one cycle after request.\n   - Ack only when cyc_i is active.\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - Ack deasserts after one cycle unless a new request starts.\n   - No ack during reset (sync or async).\n   - No spurious acks (ack only after request).\n   - Data validity during read acks.\n\nNow, implementing these with the fixes from the feedback:\n\n- For back-to-back transactions, modify the ack_one_cycle property to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present.\n- Add a spurious ack check using $past.\n- Add data validity check for reads.\n- Ensure reset checks cover both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.\n\nTesting for syntax and correctness, ensuring no new signals are introduced and all assertions align with the spec.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] Check signal width using $bits\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request (WISHBONE 2-cycle rule)\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i is active (WISHBONE protocol)\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\n// [Functionality] No spurious acks (ack only after valid request)\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_spurious_ack);\n\n// [Functionality] Ack duration (1 cycle unless back-to-back request)\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset condition (sync/async)\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\n// [Functionality] Data validity during read acks\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (data_valid_on_ack);\n```": [

For multi-cycle, adding `throughout wb_cyc_i[*1:$]` ensures the request was active at least once in the past cycles.\n4. **Ack Duration**: The corrected `ack_one_cycle` now allows ack to persist if a new request is present, using logical OR.\n5. **Reset Handling**: Split into synchronous and asynchronous checks. The synchronous part uses `disable iff`, and an `always` block handles async resets (though non-synthesizable, it's a simulation check).\n6. **Data Validity**: Already correct, no changes.\n7. **Single Ack Per Request**: Added a new assertion to prevent multiple acks per request using `|-> ##[1:2] wb_ack_o [->1]`.\n\nI also need to ensure all assertions are segregated into width, connectivity, and functionality sections as per the user's latest instruction.

        "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `wb_ack_o` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. First, I need to recall the key points from the specification and the feedback given.\n\nFrom the specification, `wb_ack_o` is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a completed bus cycle. Each access takes two clock cycles. The previous feedback highlighted issues with timing (using 1 cycle instead of 2), missing data validity checks, and incomplete reset handling.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. Since `wb_ack_o` is defined as 1-bit, a simple check using `$bits` is needed. However, in SystemVerilog, `$bits` is a compile-time function, so a static assertion isn't necessary. But to be thorough, maybe include a comment about the width, though it's not a runtime check.\n\nNext, connectivity. The WISHBONE interface requires that `wb_ack_o` asserts exactly two cycles after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are both high. The previous assertion used `|=>`, which is a one-cycle delay, but the correct delay is two cycles. So, the property should use `##1` to add another cycle, making it `|=> ##1 wb_ack_o`.\n\nFor functionality, ensuring that `wb_ack_o` is only high for one cycle per transaction is crucial. The previous attempt had a property that tried to handle deassertion but used a ternary operator, which was confusing. A better approach is to assert that once `wb_ack_o` rises, it must fall on the next cycle, ensuring a single-cycle pulse.\n\nAnother functionality point is checking that `wb_ack_o` only follows a valid request. The original assertion used `$past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1)`, but since the ack comes two cycles later, it should be `$past(..., 2)` instead.\n\nReset handling needs to ensure that during any reset (asynchronous or synchronous), `wb_ack_o` remains low. Also, after reset, the signal shouldn't glitch. The assertion should check that whenever reset is active, `wb_ack_o` is low, not just at the clock edge but throughout the reset period.\n\nData validity is another aspect. When `wb_ack_o` is high, the data on `wb_dat_o` should be valid and stable. An assertion should check that `wb_dat_o` isn't unknown (X or Z) when `wb_ack_o` is high.\n\nBack-to-back transactions need consideration. If a new request starts immediately after an ack, the two-cycle rule still applies. The ack from the first transaction should deassert, and the new ack should come two cycles after the new request.\n\nPutting this all together, the SVAs should cover:\n\n1. Correct two-cycle delay from request to ack.\n2. Ack only when `wb_cyc_i` was active in the previous cycle.\n3. No spurious acks without a prior request.\n4. Ack deasserts after one cycle.\n5. Reset conditions keep ack low.\n6. Data validity when ack is high.\n\nEach of these points translates into specific properties. Now, structuring them properly while avoiding syntax errors and adhering to the spec is key. Also, ensuring that all feedback points are addressed, especially the timing correction from one cycle to two cycles.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] - Static check (wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit)\n// No runtime assertion needed for fixed-width signals\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts exactly 2 cycles after valid request\nproperty ack_timing;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i was active in previous cycle\nproperty ack_cyc_relationship;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_cyc_relationship);\n\n// [Functionality] Single-cycle ack pulse\nproperty ack_pulse_width;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  $rose(wb_ack_o) |=> $fell(wb_ack_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_pulse_width);\n\n// [Functionality] Valid data with ack\nproperty ack_data_valid;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_data_valid);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset clears ack persistently\nproperty ack_reset_behavior;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> ##[0:$] !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset_behavior);\n\n// [Functionality] No ack without prior request\nproperty ack_causality;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 2);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_causality);\n``` \n\n**Key Improvements from Feedback**:\n1. **2-Cycle Timing**: Fixed with `|=> ##1` to match spec's 2-cycle access\n2. **Data Validity**: Added check for stable `wb_dat_o` during ack\n3. **Reset Robustness**: Used `##[0:$]` to cover entire reset duration\n4. **Protocol Compliance**: Enforced single-cycle ack pulse and WISHBONE cyc_i rules\n5. **Causality Check**: Uses `$past(...,2)` for correct request-ack timing": [

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit.

            "<think>\n\nOkay, let's analyze the provided SVAs for `wb_ack_o` based on the specifications and the user's feedback request. I need to check for correctness, consistency, completeness, and potential flaws. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**:\n   - **Provided**: `assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);`\n   - **Analysis**: Correct. Ensures `wb_ack_o` is strictly 1-bit. No issues here.\n\n2. **Ack After Request**:\n   - **Provided**: Uses `|=>` to check `wb_ack_o` asserts one cycle after `wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i`.\n   - **Flaw**: The specification states **each access takes 2 clock cycles**, but the assertion assumes `wb_ack_o` asserts **immediately** after the request (next cycle). However, in WISHBONE Classic, `wb_ack_o` typically asserts in the **second cycle** of a 2-cycle access. The assertion is correct if the core asserts `wb_ack_o` on the next cycle after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high. But if the access spans two cycles (address phase → data phase), the assertion is valid. No explicit flaw here, but depends on the core’s exact timing.\n\n3. **Ack Only With cyc_i**:\n   - **Provided**: Checks `wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i`.\n   - **Flaw**: Correct per WISHBONE rules. However, it misses checking `wb_stb_i`. While `wb_cyc_i` must be high during `wb_ack_o`, `wb_stb_i` might be low in the data phase (second cycle). The assertion is still compliant because WISHBONE only requires `wb_cyc_i` during `wb_ack_o`. No flaw here.\n\n4. **Ack One Cycle**:\n   - **Provided**: Ensures `wb_ack_o` deasserts after one cycle.\n   - **Flaw**: Correct for single transfers. However, if back-to-back requests occur (e.g., `wb_stb_i` stays high), `wb_ack_o` could assert again immediately. The assertion would fail in this case. The property should allow `wb_ack_o` to stay high if a new request is present. **Flaw: Does not account for consecutive transactions**.\n\n5. **Ack During Reset**:\n   - **Provided**: Checks `(arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o`.\n   - **Flaw**: Asynchronous reset (`arst_i`) can occur at any time, but the assertion only checks at clock edges. If `arst_i` asserts asynchronously, `wb_ack_o` might glitch between clock edges. The assertion cannot catch this. **Flaw: Incomplete reset coverage for asynchronous resets**.\n\n6. **Missing Assertions**:\n   - **No Check for Spurious Acks**: There’s no assertion to ensure `wb_ack_o` never asserts without a prior `wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i`.\n   - **No Check for Data Validity**: When `wb_ack_o` is high during a read, `wb_dat_o` should be valid. This is not verified.\n   - **No Multi-Master Arbitration Check**: While not directly related to `wb_ack_o`, the core’s arbitration loss (`AL` bit) should cancel transactions, but this isn’t linked to `wb_ack_o` behavior.\n\n7. **Clock Cycle Misinterpretations**:\n   - The assertion `ack_after_request` uses `|=>`, which implies a 1-cycle delay. If the core’s 2-cycle access includes the cycle where `wb_stb_i` is high as the first cycle and `wb_ack_o` in the second, this is correct.

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specifications and the feedback from the previous attempt. Let's start by reviewing the requirements and the issues identified in the prior version.\n\nFirst, the width assertion is straightforward—wb_ack_o is a 1-bit signal, so checking its width is essential. That part is correct and doesn't need changes.\n\nNext, connectivity. The previous assertion checked that wb_ack_o asserts one cycle after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high. The feedback mentioned that this might not account for back-to-back transactions. However, according to the WISHBONE spec, each access takes two cycles, so the ack should come exactly one cycle after the request. The original assertion is correct, but the feedback suggested that the ack_one_cycle assertion was too restrictive. The fix was to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present. So I need to adjust the ack_one_cycle property to handle consecutive transactions.\n\nThen, the functionality checks. The previous version missed checking for spurious acks (ack without a prior request) and data validity during read operations. Also, the reset check didn't account for asynchronous resets properly.\n\nFor the reset condition, the original assertion checked that during reset, ack is low. However, asynchronous resets can occur at any time, not just clock edges. The feedback suggested adding an always block to check asynchronous resets, but SVAs are synchronous. So perhaps using a concurrent assertion with $inferred_clock might help, but it's tricky. Alternatively, rely on the disable iff clause to handle resets.\n\nThe data validity check for reads wasn't in the original SVAs. The user's specification mentions that wb_dat_o is valid when ack is high during a read, so adding that is necessary.\n\nPutting this all together, here's the plan:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: Keep as is.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - Ack asserts one cycle after request.\n   - Ack only when cyc_i is active.\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - Ack deasserts after one cycle unless a new request starts.\n   - No ack during reset (sync or async).\n   - No spurious acks (ack only after request).\n   - Data validity during read acks.\n\nNow, implementing these with the fixes from the feedback:\n\n- For back-to-back transactions, modify the ack_one_cycle property to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present.\n- Add a spurious ack check using $past.\n- Add data validity check for reads.\n- Ensure reset checks cover both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.\n\nTesting for syntax and correctness, ensuring no new signals are introduced and all assertions align with the spec.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] Check signal width using $bits\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request (WISHBONE 2-cycle rule)\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i is active (WISHBONE protocol)\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\n// [Functionality] No spurious acks (ack only after valid request)\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_spurious_ack);\n\n// [Functionality] Ack duration (1 cycle unless back-to-back request)\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset condition (sync/async)\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\n// [Functionality] Data validity during read acks\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (data_valid_on_ack);\n```": [
            "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the feedback for the generated SVAs for `wb_ack_o` based on the specifications and the user's strict requirements. The goal is to identify every possible flaw, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, clock cycle misinterpretations, nested conditions, and long expressions. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### **1. Width Assertion**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Correct. Ensures `wb_ack_o` is 1-bit as per spec.\n- **Consistency**: Aligns with the signal definition.\n- **Completeness**: None. No issues here.\n\n**Score**: +100 (No flaws).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Connectivity: `ack_after_request`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Partially correct. The assertion enforces that `wb_ack_o` asserts **exactly** one cycle after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high. However, the WISHBONE spec allows for variable latency (ack can come after **any** number of cycles as long as `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` remain asserted). The current assertion assumes fixed 2-cycle latency, which is **not** universally true for all WISHBONE implementations.\n- **Consistency**: Violates WISHBONE flexibility. The core’s spec says \"each access takes 2 clock cycles,\" so this is acceptable, but the assertion should explicitly check for **exactly** 2 cycles.\n- **Completeness**: Missing check for `wb_ack_o` **only** after a valid request. The current code allows `wb_ack_o` to assert even if `wb_stb_i` or `wb_cyc_i` drop before the next cycle (e.g., if the master aborts the request).\n\n**Score**: -20 (Assumes fixed latency, misses abort cases).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Connectivity: `ack_with_cyc`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Correct. WISHBONE mandates that `wb_ack_o` is only valid during an active cycle (`wb_cyc_i` high).\n- **Consistency**: Aligns with spec.\n- **Completeness**: None. Well-formed.\n\n**Score**: +100 (No flaws).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Functionality: `no_spurious_ack`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Partially correct. Checks that `wb_ack_o` follows a request from the previous cycle. However, it does not account for multi-cycle requests where `wb_stb_i`/`wb_cyc_i` might stay high for multiple cycles (e.g., pipelined transactions). The assertion would falsely flag valid acks in such cases.\n- **Consistency**: Incorrect for multi-master or pipelined scenarios. The core’s spec does not mention pipelining, so this is acceptable if the core only supports single-cycle requests.\n- **Completeness**: Misses cases where `wb_stb_i`/`wb_cyc_i` are held high for multiple cycles. The assertion assumes one request per ack, which may not hold.\n\n**Score**: -10 (Fails for multi-cycle requests).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Functionality: `ack_one_cycle`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Flawed. The `throughout` operator checks that `!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i)` holds **continuously** from the next cycle onward, which is overly restrictive. The intent was to allow `wb_ack_o` to stay high if a new request occurs, but the logic is inverted. The correct approach is:\n  ```systemverilog\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o || (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\n  ```\n- **Consistency**: Misuses `throughout`, leading to false failures. For example, if `wb_stb_i`/`wb_cyc_i` toggle after `wb_ack_o`, the assertion fails unnecessarily.\n- **Completeness**: Does not properly handle back-to-back requests. The current code forces `wb_ack_o` to deassert even if a new request is present.\n\n**Score**: -30 (Incorrect use of `throughout`, logic inversion).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Functionality: `ack_reset`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Partially correct. Checks synchronous reset but **ignores asynchronous reset** (`arst_i`). Asynchronous reset can occur at any time (not just clock edges), so this assertion misses cases where `arst_i` is asserted between clock edges, leaving `wb_ack_o` undetected.\n- **Consistency**: Fails to cover asynchronous reset fully. The `disable iff` clause in other properties handles resets, but this assertion only checks at clock edges.\n- **Completeness**: Needs an additional check using `$inferred_clock` or combinational logic for asynchronous resets, which is not feasible in SVAs. Alternative: Use `always @(arst_i or wb_rst_i) assert (!wb_ack_o);` but this is not synthesizable.\n\n**Score**: -15 (Misses asynchronous reset edge cases).\n\n---\n\n### **7. Functionality: `data_valid_on_ack`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Correct. Ensures `wb_dat_o` is stable during read acks.\n- **Consistency**: Aligns with spec’s note that \"output signals are registered.\"\n- **Completeness**: None. Well-formed.\n\n**Score**: +100 (No flaws).\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Flaws**\n1. **Clock Cycle Misinterpretations**:\n   - `ack_after_request` assumes fixed 2-cycle latency. If the core ever takes >1 cycle to respond (e.g., due to clock stretching), this assertion fails. The spec says \"each access takes 2 clock cycles,\" so this is acceptable but should be explicitly noted.\n   \n2. **Nested Conditions**:\n   - `arst_i == ARST_LVL` is repeated in every `disable iff`. This could be error-prone if `ARST_LVL` is redefined. Better to use a macro or parameter.\n\n3. **Missing Checks**:\n   - No assertion ensures `wb_ack_o` is **only** asserted for one cycle per request. A burst of acks could occur if the core malfunctions.\n   - No check for `wb_ack_o` during write cycles (e.g., `wb_we_i` high). The spec does not differentiate read/write for acks, but this could be an oversight.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Score**\n- **Correctness**: 70/100 (Flaws in latency, reset, and ack duration).\n- **Consistency**: 80/100 (Mostly aligns with spec but misses edge cases).\n- **Completeness**: 60/100 (Missing multi-cycle request handling, burst ack checks).\n- **Total**: **60/100** (Needs fixes for reset, ack duration, and multi-cycle cases).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. Fix `ack_one_cycle` using `|=> !wb_ack_o || (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i)`.\n2. Replace `ack_after_request` with a check for **exactly** 2-cycle latency if the spec mandates it.\n3. Add an assertion to prevent multiple acks per request.\n4. Use `always_comb` for asynchronous reset checks (non-SVA) if possible.\n5.

            "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at the SVAs provided for wb_ack_o. The user wants me to critique them strictly, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, and clock cycle misinterpretations. Let's go through each assertion one by one.\n\nFirst, the \"ack_after_request\" property. It checks that after a valid request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i high), wb_ack_o asserts in the next cycle. But wait, the specification says each access takes two clock cycles. So the ack should come two cycles after the request, not one. This is a major flaw. The current assertion would fail because it's expecting the ack too early. That's a clock cycle misinterpretation.\n\nNext, \"ack_only_with_cyc\" ensures that ack is only high when cyc_i is active. That seems correct according to WISHBONE rules. But does it account for the possibility that cyc_i might drop in the same cycle as ack? The standard allows cyc_i to drop when ack is received, so maybe the assertion should check that cyc_i was active in the previous cycle when ack is asserted. Otherwise, there might be a false failure if cyc_i and ack drop simultaneously.\n\nThe \"no_spurious_ack\" property uses $past to check that a valid request occurred in the previous cycle. But if the request is sustained over multiple cycles, does this assertion handle that? Also, the specification mentions that each access takes two cycles. So the ack should come two cycles after the request, not one. This assertion is checking the wrong timing, similar to the first one. It's using $past(...,1) which is one cycle, but it should be two cycles. This is another clock cycle error.\n\nThen there's \"ack_deassert_unless_new_req\". The property says that if ack is high, then in the next cycle it should stay high only if there's a new request. But the way it's written might not handle back-to-back transactions correctly. Also, the syntax \"wb_ack_o |=> (wb_ack_o ? ...)\" could be simplified. Moreover, the specification says that each access takes two cycles, so consecutive acks might not be possible unless there's a pipelined request. The current assertion might not align with the two-cycle access rule, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nThe \"ack_reset\" property checks that during reset, ack is low. But the reset could be asynchronous (arst_i) or synchronous (wb_rst_i). The current assertion covers both, which is good. However, it doesn't check that ack remains low for the duration of the reset. If the reset is deasserted but then reasserted, does the assertion hold? Also, after reset deassertion, there might be a race condition if a request is made immediately. The assertion only checks the reset condition at the posedge, which is correct, but maybe there's a need to ensure that ack doesn't glitch during reset transitions.\n\nOther issues: The SVAs don't check the relationship between ack and the data signals (wb_dat_i, wb_dat_o). The specification mentions that all outputs are registered, so when ack is high, the data from the core (wb_dat_o) should be valid. There's no assertion ensuring that wb_dat_o is stable when ack is high. This is a completeness issue.\n\nAlso, the specification says that the core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with 2-cycle accesses. The current assertions don't verify that the ack occurs exactly two cycles after the request. They assume one cycle, which is incorrect. This is a major correctness issue across multiple properties.\n\nAnother point: The \"ack_deassert_unless_new_req\" property uses a ternary operator which might not be the clearest way to express the condition. It could be split into two separate properties for clarity. Additionally, the property might not handle the case where a new request starts in the same cycle as the ack is deasserting. There's a potential for overlapping transactions that aren't accounted for.\n\nLastly, there's no check for the maximum duration of ack. According to the spec, each access is two cycles, so ack should be high for exactly one cycle per request. The current assertions don't ensure that ack doesn't stay high longer than necessary, leading to possible protocol violations.\n\nIn summary, the main flaws are:\n1. Incorrect timing (1 cycle vs 2 cycles for ack).\n2. Missing checks for data validity with ack.\n3. Potential issues with back-to-back transactions and ack deassertion.\n4. No handling of the exact two-cycle access requirement.\n5. Possible oversights in reset behavior and signal stability.\n</think>\n\n**Critical Feedback on SVAs for `wb_ack_o`**  \n**Score: -65/100**  \n\n### **1. Clock Cycle Misinterpretation (Severe)**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **All assertions assume 1-cycle latency** between `wb_stb_i/wb_cyc_i` and `wb_ack_o`, but the specification explicitly states **2 clock cycles per access** (Section 2.2: \"Each access takes 2 clock cycles\").  \n  - Example: `ack_after_request` uses `|=>` (1-cycle delay), but it should use `|=> ##1 wb_ack_o`.  \n  - **Impact**: All timing-related assertions are fundamentally incorrect.  \n\n### **2. Incomplete Protocol Compliance**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **Missing check for `wb_ack_o` duration**: The spec requires `wb_ack_o` to pulse for **exactly 1 cycle per transaction**. No assertion ensures it doesn’t stay asserted for multiple cycles.  \n- **No data validity check**: When `wb_ack_o` is high, `wb_dat_o` (for reads) must be stable. Missing assertion:  \n  ```systemverilog\n  assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o));  \n  ```  \n\n### **3. Weak Reset Handling**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **Ignores asynchronous reset glitches**: The `ack_reset` property checks reset at the clock edge but doesn’t ensure `wb_ack_o` stays low **throughout** reset (e.g., during asynchronous reset transitions).  \n- **No recovery check**: Missing assertion to ensure `wb_ack_o` doesn’t assert prematurely after reset deassertion.  \n\n### **4. Back-to-Back Transaction Issues**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **`ack_deassert_unless_new_req` is ambiguous**:  \n  - Fails to account for the **2-cycle access rule** for consecutive transactions.  \n  - Incorrectly uses ternary operator (`wb_ack_o ? ...`), which doesn’t enforce strict deassertion after one cycle. Replace with:  \n    ```systemverilog\n    wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o // Must deassert after 1 cycle  \n    ```  \n\n### **5. Spurious Ack Check Incompleteness**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **`no_spurious_ack` uses `$past(...,1)`**: This assumes a 1-cycle request-to-ack latency, which violates the spec’s 2-cycle requirement. Correct version:  \n  ```systemverilog\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 2)  \n  ```  \n\n### **6. WISHBONE Rule Violations**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **`ack_only_with_cyc` is too lenient**: It allows `wb_ack_o` to assert if `wb_cyc_i` drops in the same cycle (violates WISHBONE RevB.3). Strengthen with:  \n  ```systemverilog\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_cyc_i, 1)  \n  ```  \n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**  \n1. **Fix 2-Cycle Access Timing**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property ack_after_request;  \n     @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)  \n     (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;  \n   endproperty  \n   ```  \n2. **Add Data Stability Assertion**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o));  \n   ```  \n3. **Strengthen Reset Checks**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property ack_reset_holds;  \n     @(posedge wb_clk_i)  \n     (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> ##[0:$] !wb_ack_o;  \n   endproperty  \n   ```  \n4. **Enforce 1-Cycle Ack Pulse**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $rose(wb_ack_o) |=> $fell(wb_ack_o));  \n   ```  \n\n**Final Score Adjustment**: **+35** after fixes."

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit. Use `$bits` to verify.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - WISHBONE requires `wb_ack_o` to assert **exactly one cycle** after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high (2-cycle access).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only be high when `wb_cyc_i` is active (WISHBONE rule).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_ack_o` must **never** assert during reset (sync or async).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must deassert after one cycle unless a new request occurs.\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only follow valid requests (no spurious acks).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check with `$bits`.\n- **Timing**: Use overlapping implication to ensure ack follows request.\n- **Reset**: Check ack is low during reset.\n- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure ack aligns with WISHBONE standards.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// Functionality: Ack only when cyc_i is active\nproperty ack_only_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_with_cyc);\n\n// Functionality: Ack deasserts after one cycle\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// Reset condition: Ack never asserted during reset\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n```": [

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

The Byte Command Controller tells the Bit Command Controller\nwhich operation has to be performed. For a single byte read, the Bit Command Controller\nreceives 8 separate read commands. Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation.",
            "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit. Use `$bits` to verify.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - WISHBONE requires `wb_ack_o` to assert **exactly one cycle** after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high (2-cycle access).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only be high when `wb_cyc_i` is active (WISHBONE rule).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_ack_o` must **never** assert during reset (sync or async).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must deassert after one cycle unless a new request occurs.\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only follow valid requests (no spurious acks).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check with `$bits`.\n- **Timing**: Use overlapping implication to ensure ack follows request.\n- **Reset**: Check ack is low during reset.\n- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure ack aligns with WISHBONE standards.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// Functionality: Ack only when cyc_i is active\nproperty ack_only_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_with_cyc);\n\n// Functionality: Ack deasserts after one cycle\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// Reset condition: Ack never asserted during reset\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n```"

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specifications and the feedback from the previous attempt. Let's start by reviewing the requirements and the issues identified in the prior version.\n\nFirst, the width assertion is straightforward—wb_ack_o is a 1-bit signal, so checking its width is essential. That part is correct and doesn't need changes.\n\nNext, connectivity. The previous assertion checked that wb_ack_o asserts one cycle after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high. The feedback mentioned that this might not account for back-to-back transactions. However, according to the WISHBONE spec, each access takes two cycles, so the ack should come exactly one cycle after the request. The original assertion is correct, but the feedback suggested that the ack_one_cycle assertion was too restrictive. The fix was to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present. So I need to adjust the ack_one_cycle property to handle consecutive transactions.\n\nThen, the functionality checks. The previous version missed checking for spurious acks (ack without a prior request) and data validity during read operations. Also, the reset check didn't account for asynchronous resets properly.\n\nFor the reset condition, the original assertion checked that during reset, ack is low. However, asynchronous resets can occur at any time, not just clock edges. The feedback suggested adding an always block to check asynchronous resets, but SVAs are synchronous. So perhaps using a concurrent assertion with $inferred_clock might help, but it's tricky. Alternatively, rely on the disable iff clause to handle resets.\n\nThe data validity check for reads wasn't in the original SVAs. The user's specification mentions that wb_dat_o is valid when ack is high during a read, so adding that is necessary.\n\nPutting this all together, here's the plan:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: Keep as is.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - Ack asserts one cycle after request.\n   - Ack only when cyc_i is active.\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - Ack deasserts after one cycle unless a new request starts.\n   - No ack during reset (sync or async).\n   - No spurious acks (ack only after request).\n   - Data validity during read acks.\n\nNow, implementing these with the fixes from the feedback:\n\n- For back-to-back transactions, modify the ack_one_cycle property to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present.\n- Add a spurious ack check using $past.\n- Add data validity check for reads.\n- Ensure reset checks cover both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.\n\nTesting for syntax and correctness, ensuring no new signals are introduced and all assertions align with the spec.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] Check signal width using $bits\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request (WISHBONE 2-cycle rule)\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i is active (WISHBONE protocol)\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\n// [Functionality] No spurious acks (ack only after valid request)\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_spurious_ack);\n\n// [Functionality] Ack duration (1 cycle unless back-to-back request)\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset condition (sync/async)\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\n// [Functionality] Data validity during read acks\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (data_valid_on_ack);\n```": [

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

The Byte Command Controller tells the Bit Command Controller\nwhich operation has to be performed. For a single byte read, the Bit Command Controller\nreceives 8 separate read commands. Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation.",
            "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit. Use `$bits` to verify.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - WISHBONE requires `wb_ack_o` to assert **exactly one cycle** after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high (2-cycle access).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only be high when `wb_cyc_i` is active (WISHBONE rule).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_ack_o` must **never** assert during reset (sync or async).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must deassert after one cycle unless a new request occurs.\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only follow valid requests (no spurious acks).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check with `$bits`.\n- **Timing**: Use overlapping implication to ensure ack follows request.\n- **Reset**: Check ack is low during reset.\n- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure ack aligns with WISHBONE standards.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// Functionality: Ack only when cyc_i is active\nproperty ack_only_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_with_cyc);\n\n// Functionality: Ack deasserts after one cycle\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// Reset condition: Ack never asserted during reset\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n```",
            "<think>\n\nOkay, let's analyze the provided SVAs for `wb_ack_o` based on the specifications and the user's feedback request. I need to check for correctness, consistency, completeness, and potential flaws. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**:\n   - **Provided**: `assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);`\n   - **Analysis**: Correct. Ensures `wb_ack_o` is strictly 1-bit. No issues here.\n\n2. **Ack After Request**:\n   - **Provided**: Uses `|=>` to check `wb_ack_o` asserts one cycle after `wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i`.\n   - **Flaw**: The specification states **each access takes 2 clock cycles**, but the assertion assumes `wb_ack_o` asserts **immediately** after the request (next cycle). However, in WISHBONE Classic, `wb_ack_o` typically asserts in the **second cycle** of a 2-cycle access. The assertion is correct if the core asserts `wb_ack_o` on the next cycle after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high. But if the access spans two cycles (address phase → data phase), the assertion is valid. No explicit flaw here, but depends on the core’s exact timing.\n\n3. **Ack Only With cyc_i**:\n   - **Provided**: Checks `wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i`.\n   - **Flaw**: Correct per WISHBONE rules. However, it misses checking `wb_stb_i`. While `wb_cyc_i` must be high during `wb_ack_o`, `wb_stb_i` might be low in the data phase (second cycle). The assertion is still compliant because WISHBONE only requires `wb_cyc_i` during `wb_ack_o`. No flaw here.\n\n4. **Ack One Cycle**:\n   - **Provided**: Ensures `wb_ack_o` deasserts after one cycle.\n   - **Flaw**: Correct for single transfers. However, if back-to-back requests occur (e.g., `wb_stb_i` stays high), `wb_ack_o` could assert again immediately. The assertion would fail in this case. The property should allow `wb_ack_o` to stay high if a new request is present. **Flaw: Does not account for consecutive transactions**.\n\n5. **Ack During Reset**:\n   - **Provided**: Checks `(arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o`.\n   - **Flaw**: Asynchronous reset (`arst_i`) can occur at any time, but the assertion only checks at clock edges. If `arst_i` asserts asynchronously, `wb_ack_o` might glitch between clock edges. The assertion cannot catch this. **Flaw: Incomplete reset coverage for asynchronous resets**.\n\n6. **Missing Assertions**:\n   - **No Check for Spurious Acks**: There’s no assertion to ensure `wb_ack_o` never asserts without a prior `wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i`.\n   - **No Check for Data Validity**: When `wb_ack_o` is high during a read, `wb_dat_o` should be valid. This is not verified.\n   - **No Multi-Master Arbitration Check**: While not directly related to `wb_ack_o`, the core’s arbitration loss (`AL` bit) should cancel transactions, but this isn’t linked to `wb_ack_o` behavior.\n\n7. **Clock Cycle Misinterpretations**:\n   - The assertion `ack_after_request` uses `|=>`, which implies a 1-cycle delay. If the core’s 2-cycle access includes the cycle where `wb_stb_i` is high as the first cycle and `wb_ack_o` in the second, this is correct. However, if the core has additional pipeline stages, this might not hold. The spec is unclear on exact timing, but the provided assertion aligns with the description.\n\n8. **Nested Conditions**:\n   - The properties use simple implications. No nested conditions, so no issue here.\n\n**Score Calculation**:\n- **Correctness**: 80/100 (Fails to handle back-to-back transactions and asynchronous reset glitches).\n- **Consistency**: 90/100 (Mostly aligns with WISHBONE rules but misses `wb_stb_i` in some checks).\n- **Completeness**: 70/100 (Missing checks for spurious acks, data validity, and reset glitches).\n\n**Final Score**: **75/100**\n\n**Critical Feedback**:\n1. **Back-to-Back Transactions**: The `ack_one_cycle` assertion is too restrictive. It should allow `wb_ack_o` to assert again if a new request occurs immediately.  \n   **Fix**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property ack_one_cycle;\n     @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n     wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\n   endproperty\n   ```\n\n2. **Asynchronous Reset Glitches**: The reset assertion only checks at clock edges. Use `async_arst` check if possible (though SVAs are synchronous).  \n   **Fix**: Add a concurrent `always` check (outside SVA) for asynchronous reset:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   always @(posedge arst_i) if (arst_i == ARST_LVL) assert (!wb_ack_o);\n   ```\n\n3. **Spurious Acks**: Add an assertion to ensure `wb_ack_o` only follows valid requests:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property no_spurious_ack;\n     @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n     wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\n   endproperty\n   assert property (no_spurious_ack);\n   ```\n\n4. **Data Validity**: For read cycles, ensure `wb_dat_o` is stable when `wb_ack_o` is high:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property data_valid_on_ack;\n     @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n     (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\n   endproperty\n   assert property (data_valid_on_ack);\n   ```\n\n**Conclusion**: The SVAs are mostly correct but lack coverage for edge cases like back-to-back transactions, asynchronous reset glitches, and data validity.

            "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specifications and the feedback from the previous attempt. Let's start by reviewing the requirements and the issues identified in the prior version.\n\nFirst, the width assertion is straightforward—wb_ack_o is a 1-bit signal, so checking its width is essential. That part is correct and doesn't need changes.\n\nNext, connectivity. The previous assertion checked that wb_ack_o asserts one cycle after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high. The feedback mentioned that this might not account for back-to-back transactions. However, according to the WISHBONE spec, each access takes two cycles, so the ack should come exactly one cycle after the request. The original assertion is correct, but the feedback suggested that the ack_one_cycle assertion was too restrictive. The fix was to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present. So I need to adjust the ack_one_cycle property to handle consecutive transactions.\n\nThen, the functionality checks. The previous version missed checking for spurious acks (ack without a prior request) and data validity during read operations. Also, the reset check didn't account for asynchronous resets properly.\n\nFor the reset condition, the original assertion checked that during reset, ack is low. However, asynchronous resets can occur at any time, not just clock edges. The feedback suggested adding an always block to check asynchronous resets, but SVAs are synchronous. So perhaps using a concurrent assertion with $inferred_clock might help, but it's tricky. Alternatively, rely on the disable iff clause to handle resets.\n\nThe data validity check for reads wasn't in the original SVAs. The user's specification mentions that wb_dat_o is valid when ack is high during a read, so adding that is necessary.\n\nPutting this all together, here's the plan:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: Keep as is.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - Ack asserts one cycle after request.\n   - Ack only when cyc_i is active.\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - Ack deasserts after one cycle unless a new request starts.\n   - No ack during reset (sync or async).\n   - No spurious acks (ack only after request).\n   - Data validity during read acks.\n\nNow, implementing these with the fixes from the feedback:\n\n- For back-to-back transactions, modify the ack_one_cycle property to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present.\n- Add a spurious ack check using $past.\n- Add data validity check for reads.\n- Ensure reset checks cover both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.\n\nTesting for syntax and correctness, ensuring no new signals are introduced and all assertions align with the spec.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] Check signal width using $bits\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request (WISHBONE 2-cycle rule)\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i is active (WISHBONE protocol)\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\n// [Functionality] No spurious acks (ack only after valid request)\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_spurious_ack);\n\n// [Functionality] Ack duration (1 cycle unless back-to-back request)\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset condition (sync/async)\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\n// [Functionality] Data validity during read acks\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (data_valid_on_ack);\n```"
        ],
        "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle generating the SVAs for `wb_ack_o` again, incorporating the feedback and ensuring all syntax and semantic issues are addressed. \n\nFirst, I'll start by revisiting the specifications and the previous errors. The main issues were around the `ack_one_cycle` property misusing `throughout`, the reset condition not handling asynchronous resets properly, and missing checks for multi-cycle requests and burst acks.\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: Straightforward, no changes needed here.\n2. **Connectivity - Ack Timing**: The spec says each access takes 2 cycles, so the ack should come exactly one cycle after the request. The original `ack_after_request` used `|=>`, which is correct, but to be explicit, using `##1` ensures the 2-cycle latency.\n3. **No Spurious Acks**: The previous check used `$past`, which works for single-cycle requests. For multi-cycle, adding `throughout wb_cyc_i[*1:$]` ensures the request was active at least once in the past cycles.\n4. **Ack Duration**: The corrected `ack_one_cycle` now allows ack to persist if a new request is present, using logical OR.\n5. **Reset Handling**: Split into synchronous and asynchronous checks. The synchronous part uses `disable iff`, and an `always` block handles async resets (though non-synthesizable, it's a simulation check).\n6. **Data Validity**: Already correct, no changes.\n7. **Single Ack Per Request**: Added a new assertion to prevent multiple acks per request using `|-> ##[1:2] wb_ack_o [->1]`.\n\nI also need to ensure all assertions are segregated into width, connectivity, and functionality sections as per the user's latest instruction. Let me organize them accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] Check signal width using $bits\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts exactly 2 cycles after valid request\nproperty ack_timing;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only during active bus cycles\nproperty ack_bus_relationship;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_bus_relationship);\n\n// [Functionality] No ack during resets\nproperty ack_reset_protection;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset_protection);\n\n// [Functionality] Valid data on read acknowledgements\nproperty ack_data_validity;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_data_validity);\n\n// [Functionality] Single ack per request\nproperty single_ack_guarantee;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> ##[1:2] wb_ack_o [->1];\nendproperty\nassert property (single_ack_guarantee);\n\n// [Functionality] Ack persistence rule for back-to-back requests\nproperty ack_persistence_rule;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o || (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_persistence_rule);\n``` \n\n**Verification:**\n1.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached.

After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation.",
            "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit. Use `$bits` to verify.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - WISHBONE requires `wb_ack_o` to assert **exactly one cycle** after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high (2-cycle access).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only be high when `wb_cyc_i` is active (WISHBONE rule).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_ack_o` must **never** assert during reset (sync or async).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must deassert after one cycle unless a new request occurs.\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only follow valid requests (no spurious acks).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check with `$bits`.\n- **Timing**: Use overlapping implication to ensure ack follows request.\n- **Reset**: Check ack is low during reset.\n- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure ack aligns with WISHBONE standards.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// Functionality: Ack only when cyc_i is active\nproperty ack_only_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_with_cyc);\n\n// Functionality: Ack deasserts after one cycle\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// Reset condition: Ack never asserted during reset\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n```",
            "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the feedback for the generated SVAs for `wb_ack_o` based on the specifications and the user's strict requirements. The goal is to identify every possible flaw, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, clock cycle misinterpretations, nested conditions, and long expressions. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### **1. Width Assertion**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Correct. Ensures `wb_ack_o` is 1-bit as per spec.\n- **Consistency**: Aligns with the signal definition.\n- **Completeness**: None. No issues here.\n\n**Score**: +100 (No flaws).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Connectivity: `ack_after_request`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Partially correct. The assertion enforces that `wb_ack_o` asserts **exactly** one cycle after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high. However, the WISHBONE spec allows for variable latency (ack can come after **any** number of cycles as long as `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` remain asserted). The current assertion assumes fixed 2-cycle latency, which is **not** universally true for all WISHBONE implementations.\n- **Consistency**: Violates WISHBONE flexibility. The core’s spec says \"each access takes 2 clock cycles,\" so this is acceptable, but the assertion should explicitly check for **exactly** 2 cycles.\n- **Completeness**: Missing check for `wb_ack_o` **only** after a valid request. The current code allows `wb_ack_o` to assert even if `wb_stb_i` or `wb_cyc_i` drop before the next cycle (e.g., if the master aborts the request).\n\n**Score**: -20 (Assumes fixed latency, misses abort cases).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Connectivity: `ack_with_cyc`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Correct. WISHBONE mandates that `wb_ack_o` is only valid during an active cycle (`wb_cyc_i` high).\n- **Consistency**: Aligns with spec.\n- **Completeness**: None. Well-formed.\n\n**Score**: +100 (No flaws).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Functionality: `no_spurious_ack`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Partially correct. Checks that `wb_ack_o` follows a request from the previous cycle. However, it does not account for multi-cycle requests where `wb_stb_i`/`wb_cyc_i` might stay high for multiple cycles (e.g., pipelined transactions). The assertion would falsely flag valid acks in such cases.\n- **Consistency**: Incorrect for multi-master or pipelined scenarios. The core’s spec does not mention pipelining, so this is acceptable if the core only supports single-cycle requests.\n- **Completeness**: Misses cases where `wb_stb_i`/`wb_cyc_i` are held high for multiple cycles. The assertion assumes one request per ack, which may not hold.\n\n**Score**: -10 (Fails for multi-cycle requests).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Functionality: `ack_one_cycle`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Flawed. The `throughout` operator checks that `!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i)` holds **continuously** from the next cycle onward, which is overly restrictive. The intent was to allow `wb_ack_o` to stay high if a new request occurs, but the logic is inverted. The correct approach is:\n  ```systemverilog\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o || (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\n  ```\n- **Consistency**: Misuses `throughout`, leading to false failures. For example, if `wb_stb_i`/`wb_cyc_i` toggle after `wb_ack_o`, the assertion fails unnecessarily.\n- **Completeness**: Does not properly handle back-to-back requests. The current code forces `wb_ack_o` to deassert even if a new request is present.\n\n**Score**: -30 (Incorrect use of `throughout`, logic inversion).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Functionality: `ack_reset`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Partially correct. Checks synchronous reset but **ignores asynchronous reset** (`arst_i`). Asynchronous reset can occur at any time (not just clock edges), so this assertion misses cases where `arst_i` is asserted between clock edges, leaving `wb_ack_o` undetected.\n- **Consistency**: Fails to cover asynchronous reset fully. The `disable iff` clause in other properties handles resets, but this assertion only checks at clock edges.\n- **Completeness**: Needs an additional check using `$inferred_clock` or combinational logic for asynchronous resets, which is not feasible in SVAs. Alternative: Use `always @(arst_i or wb_rst_i) assert (!wb_ack_o);` but this is not synthesizable.\n\n**Score**: -15 (Misses asynchronous reset edge cases).\n\n---\n\n### **7. Functionality: `data_valid_on_ack`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Correct. Ensures `wb_dat_o` is stable during read acks.\n- **Consistency**: Aligns with spec’s note that \"output signals are registered.\"\n- **Completeness**: None. Well-formed.\n\n**Score**: +100 (No flaws).\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Flaws**\n1. **Clock Cycle Misinterpretations**:\n   - `ack_after_request` assumes fixed 2-cycle latency. If the core ever takes >1 cycle to respond (e.g., due to clock stretching), this assertion fails. The spec says \"each access takes 2 clock cycles,\" so this is acceptable but should be explicitly noted.\n   \n2. **Nested Conditions**:\n   - `arst_i == ARST_LVL` is repeated in every `disable iff`. This could be error-prone if `ARST_LVL` is redefined. Better to use a macro or parameter.\n\n3. **Missing Checks**:\n   - No assertion ensures `wb_ack_o` is **only** asserted for one cycle per request. A burst of acks could occur if the core malfunctions.\n   - No check for `wb_ack_o` during write cycles (e.g., `wb_we_i` high). The spec does not differentiate read/write for acks, but this could be an oversight.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Score**\n- **Correctness**: 70/100 (Flaws in latency, reset, and ack duration).\n- **Consistency**: 80/100 (Mostly aligns with spec but misses edge cases).\n- **Completeness**: 60/100 (Missing multi-cycle request handling, burst ack checks).\n- **Total**: **60/100** (Needs fixes for reset, ack duration, and multi-cycle cases).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. Fix `ack_one_cycle` using `|=> !wb_ack_o || (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i)`.\n2. Replace `ack_after_request` with a check for **exactly** 2-cycle latency if the spec mandates it.\n3. Add an assertion to prevent multiple acks per request.\n4. Use `always_comb` for asynchronous reset checks (non-SVA) if possible.\n5. Parameterize `ARST_LVL` to avoid redundancy.\n</think>\n\n**Final Answer with Corrections:**\n\n```systemverilog\n// [1] Width assertion (correct)\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// [2] Connectivity: Ack asserts exactly 2 cycles after request (spec-compliant)\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o; // Ensures 2-cycle latency\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// [3] Ack only during active cycles (correct)\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\n// [4] No spurious acks (fixed for multi-cycle requests)\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1) throughout wb_cyc_i[*1:$];\nendproperty\nassert property (no_spurious_ack);\n\n// [5] Ack duration: Deasserts unless new request (fixed)\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o || (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// [6] Reset condition (async-aware)\nproperty ack_reset_sync;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset_sync);\n\n// Async reset check (non-SVA, if allowed)\nalways @(arst_i) begin\n  if (arst_i == ARST_LVL) assert (!wb_ack_o);\nend\n\n// [7] Data validity (correct)\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (data_valid_on_ack);\n\n// [8] Single ack per request\nproperty single_ack_per_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> ##[1:2] wb_ack_o [->1];\nendproperty\nassert property (single_ack_per_request);\n```\n\n**Explanation of Fixes:**\n1. **`ack_after_request`**: Explicitly enforces 2-cycle latency using `##1` to match the spec.\n2. **`no_spurious_ack`**: Uses `throughout wb_cyc_i[*1:$]` to allow multi-cycle requests.\n3. **`ack_one_cycle`**: Simplified to allow ack to persist only if a new request occurs.\n4. **Reset Handling**: Split into synchronous (`ack_reset_sync`) and async (non-SVA `always` block).\n5. **`single_ack_per_request`**: Ensures only one ack per request, preventing bursts.",
            "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle generating the SVAs for `wb_ack_o` again, incorporating the feedback and ensuring all syntax and semantic issues are addressed. \n\nFirst, I'll start by revisiting the specifications and the previous errors. The main issues were around the `ack_one_cycle` property misusing `throughout`, the reset condition not handling asynchronous resets properly, and missing checks for multi-cycle requests and burst acks.\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: Straightforward, no changes needed here.\n2. **Connectivity - Ack Timing**: The spec says each access takes 2 cycles, so the ack should come exactly one cycle after the request. The original `ack_after_request` used `|=>`, which is correct, but to be explicit, using `##1` ensures the 2-cycle latency.\n3. **No Spurious Acks**: The previous check used `$past`, which works for single-cycle requests. For multi-cycle, adding `throughout wb_cyc_i[*1:$]` ensures the request was active at least once in the past cycles.\n4. **Ack Duration**: The corrected `ack_one_cycle` now allows ack to persist if a new request is present, using logical OR.\n5. **Reset Handling**: Split into synchronous and asynchronous checks. The synchronous part uses `disable iff`, and an `always` block handles async resets (though non-synthesizable, it's a simulation check).\n6. **Data Validity**: Already correct, no changes.\n7. **Single Ack Per Request**: Added a new assertion to prevent multiple acks per request using `|-> ##[1:2] wb_ack_o [->1]`.\n\nI also need to ensure all assertions are segregated into width, connectivity, and functionality sections as per the user's latest instruction. Let me organize them accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] Check signal width using $bits\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts exactly 2 cycles after valid request\nproperty ack_timing;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only during active bus cycles\nproperty ack_bus_relationship;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_bus_relationship);\n\n// [Functionality] No ack during resets\nproperty ack_reset_protection;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset_protection);\n\n// [Functionality] Valid data on read acknowledgements\nproperty ack_data_validity;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_data_validity);\n\n// [Functionality] Single ack per request\nproperty single_ack_guarantee;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> ##[1:2] wb_ack_o [->1];\nendproperty\nassert property (single_ack_guarantee);\n\n// [Functionality] Ack persistence rule for back-to-back requests\nproperty ack_persistence_rule;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o || (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_persistence_rule);\n``` \n\n**Verification:**\n1.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

The Byte Command Controller tells the Bit Command Controller\nwhich operation has to be performed. For a single byte read, the Bit Command Controller\nreceives 8 separate read commands. Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation.",
            "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit. Use `$bits` to verify.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - WISHBONE requires `wb_ack_o` to assert **exactly one cycle** after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high (2-cycle access).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only be high when `wb_cyc_i` is active (WISHBONE rule).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_ack_o` must **never** assert during reset (sync or async).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must deassert after one cycle unless a new request occurs.\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only follow valid requests (no spurious acks).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check with `$bits`.\n- **Timing**: Use overlapping implication to ensure ack follows request.\n- **Reset**: Check ack is low during reset.\n- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure ack aligns with WISHBONE standards.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// Functionality: Ack only when cyc_i is active\nproperty ack_only_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_with_cyc);\n\n// Functionality: Ack deasserts after one cycle\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// Reset condition: Ack never asserted during reset\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n```",

        "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `wb_ack_o` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. First, I need to recall the key points from the specification and the feedback given.\n\nFrom the specification, `wb_ack_o` is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a completed bus cycle. Each access takes two clock cycles. The previous feedback highlighted issues with timing (using 1 cycle instead of 2), missing data validity checks, and incomplete reset handling.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. Since `wb_ack_o` is defined as 1-bit, a simple check using `$bits` is needed. However, in SystemVerilog, `$bits` is a compile-time function, so a static assertion isn't necessary. But to be thorough, maybe include a comment about the width, though it's not a runtime check.\n\nNext, connectivity. The WISHBONE interface requires that `wb_ack_o` asserts exactly two cycles after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are both high. The previous assertion used `|=>`, which is a one-cycle delay, but the correct delay is two cycles. So, the property should use `##1` to add another cycle, making it `|=> ##1 wb_ack_o`.\n\nFor functionality, ensuring that `wb_ack_o` is only high for one cycle per transaction is crucial. The previous attempt had a property that tried to handle deassertion but used a ternary operator, which was confusing. A better approach is to assert that once `wb_ack_o` rises, it must fall on the next cycle, ensuring a single-cycle pulse.\n\nAnother functionality point is checking that `wb_ack_o` only follows a valid request. The original assertion used `$past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1)`, but since the ack comes two cycles later, it should be `$past(..., 2)` instead.\n\nReset handling needs to ensure that during any reset (asynchronous or synchronous), `wb_ack_o` remains low. Also, after reset, the signal shouldn't glitch. The assertion should check that whenever reset is active, `wb_ack_o` is low, not just at the clock edge but throughout the reset period.\n\nData validity is another aspect. When `wb_ack_o` is high, the data on `wb_dat_o` should be valid and stable. An assertion should check that `wb_dat_o` isn't unknown (X or Z) when `wb_ack_o` is high.\n\nBack-to-back transactions need consideration. If a new request starts immediately after an ack, the two-cycle rule still applies. The ack from the first transaction should deassert, and the new ack should come two cycles after the new request.\n\nPutting this all together, the SVAs should cover:\n\n1. Correct two-cycle delay from request to ack.\n2. Ack only when `wb_cyc_i` was active in the previous cycle.\n3. No spurious acks without a prior request.\n4. Ack deasserts after one cycle.\n5. Reset conditions keep ack low.\n6. Data validity when ack is high.\n\nEach of these points translates into specific properties. Now, structuring them properly while avoiding syntax errors and adhering to the spec is key. Also, ensuring that all feedback points are addressed, especially the timing correction from one cycle to two cycles.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] - Static check (wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit)\n// No runtime assertion needed for fixed-width signals\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts exactly 2 cycles after valid request\nproperty ack_timing;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i was active in previous cycle\nproperty ack_cyc_relationship;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_cyc_relationship);\n\n// [Functionality] Single-cycle ack pulse\nproperty ack_pulse_width;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  $rose(wb_ack_o) |=> $fell(wb_ack_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_pulse_width);\n\n// [Functionality] Valid data with ack\nproperty ack_data_valid;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_data_valid);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset clears ack persistently\nproperty ack_reset_behavior;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> ##[0:$] !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset_behavior);\n\n// [Functionality] No ack without prior request\nproperty ack_causality;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 2);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_causality);\n``` \n\n**Key Improvements from Feedback**:\n1. **2-Cycle Timing**: Fixed with `|=> ##1` to match spec's 2-cycle access\n2. **Data Validity**: Added check for stable `wb_dat_o` during ack\n3. **Reset Robustness**: Used `##[0:$]` to cover entire reset duration\n4. **Protocol Compliance**: Enforced single-cycle ack pulse and WISHBONE cyc_i rules\n5. **Causality Check**: Uses `$past(...,2)` for correct request-ack timing": [

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation.",
            "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit. Use `$bits` to verify.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - WISHBONE requires `wb_ack_o` to assert **exactly one cycle** after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high (2-cycle access).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only be high when `wb_cyc_i` is active (WISHBONE rule).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_ack_o` must **never** assert during reset (sync or async).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must deassert after one cycle unless a new request occurs.\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only follow valid requests (no spurious acks).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check with `$bits`.\n- **Timing**: Use overlapping implication to ensure ack follows request.\n- **Reset**: Check ack is low during reset.\n- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure ack aligns with WISHBONE standards.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// Functionality: Ack only when cyc_i is active\nproperty ack_only_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_with_cyc);\n\n// Functionality: Ack deasserts after one cycle\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// Reset condition: Ack never asserted during reset\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n```",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at the SVAs provided for wb_ack_o. The user wants me to critique them strictly, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, and clock cycle misinterpretations. Let's go through each assertion one by one.\n\nFirst, the \"ack_after_request\" property. It checks that after a valid request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i high), wb_ack_o asserts in the next cycle. But wait, the specification says each access takes two clock cycles. So the ack should come two cycles after the request, not one. This is a major flaw. The current assertion would fail because it's expecting the ack too early. That's a clock cycle misinterpretation.\n\nNext, \"ack_only_with_cyc\" ensures that ack is only high when cyc_i is active. That seems correct according to WISHBONE rules. But does it account for the possibility that cyc_i might drop in the same cycle as ack? The standard allows cyc_i to drop when ack is received, so maybe the assertion should check that cyc_i was active in the previous cycle when ack is asserted. Otherwise, there might be a false failure if cyc_i and ack drop simultaneously.\n\nThe \"no_spurious_ack\" property uses $past to check that a valid request occurred in the previous cycle. But if the request is sustained over multiple cycles, does this assertion handle that? Also, the specification mentions that each access takes two cycles. So the ack should come two cycles after the request, not one. This assertion is checking the wrong timing, similar to the first one. It's using $past(...,1) which is one cycle, but it should be two cycles. This is another clock cycle error.\n\nThen there's \"ack_deassert_unless_new_req\". The property says that if ack is high, then in the next cycle it should stay high only if there's a new request. But the way it's written might not handle back-to-back transactions correctly. Also, the syntax \"wb_ack_o |=> (wb_ack_o ? ...)\" could be simplified. Moreover, the specification says that each access takes two cycles, so consecutive acks might not be possible unless there's a pipelined request. The current assertion might not align with the two-cycle access rule, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nThe \"ack_reset\" property checks that during reset, ack is low. But the reset could be asynchronous (arst_i) or synchronous (wb_rst_i). The current assertion covers both, which is good. However, it doesn't check that ack remains low for the duration of the reset. If the reset is deasserted but then reasserted, does the assertion hold? Also, after reset deassertion, there might be a race condition if a request is made immediately. The assertion only checks the reset condition at the posedge, which is correct, but maybe there's a need to ensure that ack doesn't glitch during reset transitions.\n\nOther issues: The SVAs don't check the relationship between ack and the data signals (wb_dat_i, wb_dat_o). The specification mentions that all outputs are registered, so when ack is high, the data from the core (wb_dat_o) should be valid. There's no assertion ensuring that wb_dat_o is stable when ack is high. This is a completeness issue.\n\nAlso, the specification says that the core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with 2-cycle accesses. The current assertions don't verify that the ack occurs exactly two cycles after the request. They assume one cycle, which is incorrect. This is a major correctness issue across multiple properties.\n\nAnother point: The \"ack_deassert_unless_new_req\" property uses a ternary operator which might not be the clearest way to express the condition. It could be split into two separate properties for clarity. Additionally, the property might not handle the case where a new request starts in the same cycle as the ack is deasserting. There's a potential for overlapping transactions that aren't accounted for.\n\nLastly, there's no check for the maximum duration of ack. According to the spec, each access is two cycles, so ack should be high for exactly one cycle per request. The current assertions don't ensure that ack doesn't stay high longer than necessary, leading to possible protocol violations.\n\nIn summary, the main flaws are:\n1. Incorrect timing (1 cycle vs 2 cycles for ack).\n2. Missing checks for data validity with ack.\n3. Potential issues with back-to-back transactions and ack deassertion.\n4.

Possible oversights in reset behavior and signal stability.\n</think>\n\n**Critical Feedback on SVAs for `wb_ack_o`**  \n**Score: -65/100**  \n\n### **1. Clock Cycle Misinterpretation (Severe)**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **All assertions assume 1-cycle latency** between `wb_stb_i/wb_cyc_i` and `wb_ack_o`, but the specification explicitly states **2 clock cycles per access** (Section 2.2: \"Each access takes 2 clock cycles\").  \n  - Example: `ack_after_request` uses `|=>` (1-cycle delay), but it should use `|=> ##1 wb_ack_o`.  \n  - **Impact**: All timing-related assertions are fundamentally incorrect.  \n\n### **2. Incomplete Protocol Compliance**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **Missing check for `wb_ack_o` duration**: The spec requires `wb_ack_o` to pulse for **exactly 1 cycle per transaction**. No assertion ensures it doesn’t stay asserted for multiple cycles.  \n- **No data validity check**: When `wb_ack_o` is high, `wb_dat_o` (for reads) must be stable. Missing assertion:  \n  ```systemverilog\n  assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o));  \n  ```  \n\n### **3. Weak Reset Handling**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **Ignores asynchronous reset glitches**: The `ack_reset` property checks reset at the clock edge but doesn’t ensure `wb_ack_o` stays low **throughout** reset (e.g., during asynchronous reset transitions).  \n- **No recovery check**: Missing assertion to ensure `wb_ack_o` doesn’t assert prematurely after reset deassertion.  \n\n### **4. Back-to-Back Transaction Issues**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **`ack_deassert_unless_new_req` is ambiguous**:  \n  - Fails to account for the **2-cycle access rule** for consecutive transactions.  \n  - Incorrectly uses ternary operator (`wb_ack_o ? ...`), which doesn’t enforce strict deassertion after one cycle. Replace with:  \n    ```systemverilog\n    wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o // Must deassert after 1 cycle  \n    ```  \n\n### **5. Spurious Ack Check Incompleteness**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **`no_spurious_ack` uses `$past(...,1)`**: This assumes a 1-cycle request-to-ack latency, which violates the spec’s 2-cycle requirement. Correct version:  \n  ```systemverilog\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 2)  \n  ```  \n\n### **6. WISHBONE Rule Violations**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **`ack_only_with_cyc` is too lenient**: It allows `wb_ack_o` to assert if `wb_cyc_i` drops in the same cycle (violates WISHBONE RevB.3).

            "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `wb_ack_o` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. First, I need to recall the key points from the specification and the feedback given.\n\nFrom the specification, `wb_ack_o` is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a completed bus cycle. Each access takes two clock cycles. The previous feedback highlighted issues with timing (using 1 cycle instead of 2), missing data validity checks, and incomplete reset handling.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. Since `wb_ack_o` is defined as 1-bit, a simple check using `$bits` is needed. However, in SystemVerilog, `$bits` is a compile-time function, so a static assertion isn't necessary. But to be thorough, maybe include a comment about the width, though it's not a runtime check.\n\nNext, connectivity. The WISHBONE interface requires that `wb_ack_o` asserts exactly two cycles after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are both high. The previous assertion used `|=>`, which is a one-cycle delay, but the correct delay is two cycles. So, the property should use `##1` to add another cycle, making it `|=> ##1 wb_ack_o`.\n\nFor functionality, ensuring that `wb_ack_o` is only high for one cycle per transaction is crucial. The previous attempt had a property that tried to handle deassertion but used a ternary operator, which was confusing. A better approach is to assert that once `wb_ack_o` rises, it must fall on the next cycle, ensuring a single-cycle pulse.\n\nAnother functionality point is checking that `wb_ack_o` only follows a valid request. The original assertion used `$past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1)`, but since the ack comes two cycles later, it should be `$past(..., 2)` instead.\n\nReset handling needs to ensure that during any reset (asynchronous or synchronous), `wb_ack_o` remains low. Also, after reset, the signal shouldn't glitch. The assertion should check that whenever reset is active, `wb_ack_o` is low, not just at the clock edge but throughout the reset period.\n\nData validity is another aspect. When `wb_ack_o` is high, the data on `wb_dat_o` should be valid and stable. An assertion should check that `wb_dat_o` isn't unknown (X or Z) when `wb_ack_o` is high.\n\nBack-to-back transactions need consideration. If a new request starts immediately after an ack, the two-cycle rule still applies. The ack from the first transaction should deassert, and the new ack should come two cycles after the new request.\n\nPutting this all together, the SVAs should cover:\n\n1. Correct two-cycle delay from request to ack.\n2. Ack only when `wb_cyc_i` was active in the previous cycle.\n3. No spurious acks without a prior request.\n4. Ack deasserts after one cycle.\n5. Reset conditions keep ack low.\n6. Data validity when ack is high.\n\nEach of these points translates into specific properties. Now, structuring them properly while avoiding syntax errors and adhering to the spec is key. Also, ensuring that all feedback points are addressed, especially the timing correction from one cycle to two cycles.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] - Static check (wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit)\n// No runtime assertion needed for fixed-width signals\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts exactly 2 cycles after valid request\nproperty ack_timing;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i was active in previous cycle\nproperty ack_cyc_relationship;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_cyc_relationship);\n\n// [Functionality] Single-cycle ack pulse\nproperty ack_pulse_width;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  $rose(wb_ack_o) |=> $fell(wb_ack_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_pulse_width);\n\n// [Functionality] Valid data with ack\nproperty ack_data_valid;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_data_valid);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset clears ack persistently\nproperty ack_reset_behavior;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> ##[0:$] !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset_behavior);\n\n// [Functionality] No ack without prior request\nproperty ack_causality;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 2);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_causality);\n``` \n\n**Key Improvements from Feedback**:\n1. **2-Cycle Timing**: Fixed with `|=> ##1` to match spec's 2-cycle access\n2. **Data Validity**: Added check for stable `wb_dat_o` during ack\n3. **Reset Robustness**: Used `##[0:$]` to cover entire reset duration\n4. **Protocol Compliance**: Enforced single-cycle ack pulse and WISHBONE cyc_i rules\n5. **Causality Check**: Uses `$past(...,2)` for correct request-ack timing"

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit. Use `$bits` to verify.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - WISHBONE requires `wb_ack_o` to assert **exactly one cycle** after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high (2-cycle access).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only be high when `wb_cyc_i` is active (WISHBONE rule).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_ack_o` must **never** assert during reset (sync or async).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must deassert after one cycle unless a new request occurs.\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only follow valid requests (no spurious acks).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check with `$bits`.\n- **Timing**: Use overlapping implication to ensure ack follows request.\n- **Reset**: Check ack is low during reset.\n- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure ack aligns with WISHBONE standards.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// Functionality: Ack only when cyc_i is active\nproperty ack_only_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_with_cyc);\n\n// Functionality: Ack deasserts after one cycle\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// Reset condition: Ack never asserted during reset\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n```": [

                "<think>\n\nOkay, let's analyze the provided SVAs for `wb_ack_o` based on the specifications and the user's feedback request. I need to check for correctness, consistency, completeness, and potential flaws. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**:\n   - **Provided**: `assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);`\n   - **Analysis**: Correct. Ensures `wb_ack_o` is strictly 1-bit. No issues here.\n\n2. **Ack After Request**:\n   - **Provided**: Uses `|=>` to check `wb_ack_o` asserts one cycle after `wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i`.\n   - **Flaw**: The specification states **each access takes 2 clock cycles**, but the assertion assumes `wb_ack_o` asserts **immediately** after the request (next cycle). However, in WISHBONE Classic, `wb_ack_o` typically asserts in the **second cycle** of a 2-cycle access. The assertion is correct if the core asserts `wb_ack_o` on the next cycle after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high. But if the access spans two cycles (address phase → data phase), the assertion is valid. No explicit flaw here, but depends on the core’s exact timing.\n\n3. **Ack Only With cyc_i**:\n   - **Provided**: Checks `wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i`.\n   - **Flaw**: Correct per WISHBONE rules. However, it misses checking `wb_stb_i`. While `wb_cyc_i` must be high during `wb_ack_o`, `wb_stb_i` might be low in the data phase (second cycle). The assertion is still compliant because WISHBONE only requires `wb_cyc_i` during `wb_ack_o`. No flaw here.\n\n4. **Ack One Cycle**:\n   - **Provided**: Ensures `wb_ack_o` deasserts after one cycle.\n   - **Flaw**: Correct for single transfers. However, if back-to-back requests occur (e.g., `wb_stb_i` stays high), `wb_ack_o` could assert again immediately. The assertion would fail in this case. The property should allow `wb_ack_o` to stay high if a new request is present. **Flaw: Does not account for consecutive transactions**.\n\n5. **Ack During Reset**:\n   - **Provided**: Checks `(arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o`.\n   - **Flaw**: Asynchronous reset (`arst_i`) can occur at any time, but the assertion only checks at clock edges. If `arst_i` asserts asynchronously, `wb_ack_o` might glitch between clock edges. The assertion cannot catch this. **Flaw: Incomplete reset coverage for asynchronous resets**.\n\n6. **Missing Assertions**:\n   - **No Check for Spurious Acks**: There’s no assertion to ensure `wb_ack_o` never asserts without a prior `wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i`.\n   - **No Check for Data Validity**: When `wb_ack_o` is high during a read, `wb_dat_o` should be valid. This is not verified.\n   - **No Multi-Master Arbitration Check**: While not directly related to `wb_ack_o`, the core’s arbitration loss (`AL` bit) should cancel transactions, but this isn’t linked to `wb_ack_o` behavior.\n\n7. **Clock Cycle Misinterpretations**:\n   - The assertion `ack_after_request` uses `|=>`, which implies a 1-cycle delay. If the core’s 2-cycle access includes the cycle where `wb_stb_i` is high as the first cycle and `wb_ack_o` in the second, this is correct. However, if the core has additional pipeline stages, this might not hold. The spec is unclear on exact timing, but the provided assertion aligns with the description.\n\n8. **Nested Conditions**:\n   - The properties use simple implications. No nested conditions, so no issue here.\n\n**Score Calculation**:\n- **Correctness**: 80/100 (Fails to handle back-to-back transactions and asynchronous reset glitches).\n- **Consistency**: 90/100 (Mostly aligns with WISHBONE rules but misses `wb_stb_i` in some checks).\n- **Completeness**: 70/100 (Missing checks for spurious acks, data validity, and reset glitches).\n\n**Final Score**: **75/100**\n\n**Critical Feedback**:\n1. **Back-to-Back Transactions**: The `ack_one_cycle` assertion is too restrictive. It should allow `wb_ack_o` to assert again if a new request occurs immediately.  \n   **Fix**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property ack_one_cycle;\n     @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n     wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\n   endproperty\n   ```\n\n2. **Asynchronous Reset Glitches**: The reset assertion only checks at clock edges. Use `async_arst` check if possible (though SVAs are synchronous).  \n   **Fix**: Add a concurrent `always` check (outside SVA) for asynchronous reset:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   always @(posedge arst_i) if (arst_i == ARST_LVL) assert (!wb_ack_o);\n   ```\n\n3. **Spurious Acks**: Add an assertion to ensure `wb_ack_o` only follows valid requests:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property no_spurious_ack;\n     @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n     wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\n   endproperty\n   assert property (no_spurious_ack);\n   ```\n\n4. **Data Validity**: For read cycles, ensure `wb_dat_o` is stable when `wb_ack_o` is high:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property data_valid_on_ack;\n     @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n     (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\n   endproperty\n   assert property (data_valid_on_ack);\n   ```\n\n**Conclusion**: The SVAs are mostly correct but lack coverage for edge cases like back-to-back transactions, asynchronous reset glitches, and data validity.

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specifications and the feedback from the previous attempt. Let's start by reviewing the requirements and the issues identified in the prior version.\n\nFirst, the width assertion is straightforward—wb_ack_o is a 1-bit signal, so checking its width is essential. That part is correct and doesn't need changes.\n\nNext, connectivity. The previous assertion checked that wb_ack_o asserts one cycle after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high. The feedback mentioned that this might not account for back-to-back transactions. However, according to the WISHBONE spec, each access takes two cycles, so the ack should come exactly one cycle after the request. The original assertion is correct, but the feedback suggested that the ack_one_cycle assertion was too restrictive. The fix was to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present. So I need to adjust the ack_one_cycle property to handle consecutive transactions.\n\nThen, the functionality checks. The previous version missed checking for spurious acks (ack without a prior request) and data validity during read operations. Also, the reset check didn't account for asynchronous resets properly.\n\nFor the reset condition, the original assertion checked that during reset, ack is low. However, asynchronous resets can occur at any time, not just clock edges. The feedback suggested adding an always block to check asynchronous resets, but SVAs are synchronous. So perhaps using a concurrent assertion with $inferred_clock might help, but it's tricky. Alternatively, rely on the disable iff clause to handle resets.\n\nThe data validity check for reads wasn't in the original SVAs. The user's specification mentions that wb_dat_o is valid when ack is high during a read, so adding that is necessary.\n\nPutting this all together, here's the plan:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: Keep as is.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - Ack asserts one cycle after request.\n   - Ack only when cyc_i is active.\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - Ack deasserts after one cycle unless a new request starts.\n   - No ack during reset (sync or async).\n   - No spurious acks (ack only after request).\n   - Data validity during read acks.\n\nNow, implementing these with the fixes from the feedback:\n\n- For back-to-back transactions, modify the ack_one_cycle property to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present.\n- Add a spurious ack check using $past.\n- Add data validity check for reads.\n- Ensure reset checks cover both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.\n\nTesting for syntax and correctness, ensuring no new signals are introduced and all assertions align with the spec.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] Check signal width using $bits\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request (WISHBONE 2-cycle rule)\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i is active (WISHBONE protocol)\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\n// [Functionality] No spurious acks (ack only after valid request)\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_spurious_ack);\n\n// [Functionality] Ack duration (1 cycle unless back-to-back request)\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset condition (sync/async)\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\n// [Functionality] Data validity during read acks\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (data_valid_on_ack);\n```"

                "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the feedback for the generated SVAs for `wb_ack_o` based on the specifications and the user's strict requirements. The goal is to identify every possible flaw, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, clock cycle misinterpretations, nested conditions, and long expressions. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### **1. Width Assertion**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Correct. Ensures `wb_ack_o` is 1-bit as per spec.\n- **Consistency**: Aligns with the signal definition.\n- **Completeness**: None. No issues here.\n\n**Score**: +100 (No flaws).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Connectivity: `ack_after_request`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Partially correct. The assertion enforces that `wb_ack_o` asserts **exactly** one cycle after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high. However, the WISHBONE spec allows for variable latency (ack can come after **any** number of cycles as long as `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` remain asserted). The current assertion assumes fixed 2-cycle latency, which is **not** universally true for all WISHBONE implementations.\n- **Consistency**: Violates WISHBONE flexibility. The core’s spec says \"each access takes 2 clock cycles,\" so this is acceptable, but the assertion should explicitly check for **exactly** 2 cycles.\n- **Completeness**: Missing check for `wb_ack_o` **only** after a valid request. The current code allows `wb_ack_o` to assert even if `wb_stb_i` or `wb_cyc_i` drop before the next cycle (e.g., if the master aborts the request).\n\n**Score**: -20 (Assumes fixed latency, misses abort cases).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Connectivity: `ack_with_cyc`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Correct. WISHBONE mandates that `wb_ack_o` is only valid during an active cycle (`wb_cyc_i` high).\n- **Consistency**: Aligns with spec.\n- **Completeness**: None. Well-formed.\n\n**Score**: +100 (No flaws).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Functionality: `no_spurious_ack`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Partially correct. Checks that `wb_ack_o` follows a request from the previous cycle. However, it does not account for multi-cycle requests where `wb_stb_i`/`wb_cyc_i` might stay high for multiple cycles (e.g., pipelined transactions). The assertion would falsely flag valid acks in such cases.\n- **Consistency**: Incorrect for multi-master or pipelined scenarios. The core’s spec does not mention pipelining, so this is acceptable if the core only supports single-cycle requests.\n- **Completeness**: Misses cases where `wb_stb_i`/`wb_cyc_i` are held high for multiple cycles. The assertion assumes one request per ack, which may not hold.\n\n**Score**: -10 (Fails for multi-cycle requests).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Functionality: `ack_one_cycle`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Flawed. The `throughout` operator checks that `!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i)` holds **continuously** from the next cycle onward, which is overly restrictive. The intent was to allow `wb_ack_o` to stay high if a new request occurs, but the logic is inverted. The correct approach is:\n  ```systemverilog\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o || (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\n  ```\n- **Consistency**: Misuses `throughout`, leading to false failures. For example, if `wb_stb_i`/`wb_cyc_i` toggle after `wb_ack_o`, the assertion fails unnecessarily.\n- **Completeness**: Does not properly handle back-to-back requests. The current code forces `wb_ack_o` to deassert even if a new request is present.\n\n**Score**: -30 (Incorrect use of `throughout`, logic inversion).\n\n---\n\n### **6. Functionality: `ack_reset`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Partially correct. Checks synchronous reset but **ignores asynchronous reset** (`arst_i`). Asynchronous reset can occur at any time (not just clock edges), so this assertion misses cases where `arst_i` is asserted between clock edges, leaving `wb_ack_o` undetected.\n- **Consistency**: Fails to cover asynchronous reset fully. The `disable iff` clause in other properties handles resets, but this assertion only checks at clock edges.\n- **Completeness**: Needs an additional check using `$inferred_clock` or combinational logic for asynchronous resets, which is not feasible in SVAs. Alternative: Use `always @(arst_i or wb_rst_i) assert (!wb_ack_o);` but this is not synthesizable.\n\n**Score**: -15 (Misses asynchronous reset edge cases).\n\n---\n\n### **7. Functionality: `data_valid_on_ack`**\n**Code:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\n```\n**Feedback:**\n- **Correctness**: Correct. Ensures `wb_dat_o` is stable during read acks.\n- **Consistency**: Aligns with spec’s note that \"output signals are registered.\"\n- **Completeness**: None. Well-formed.\n\n**Score**: +100 (No flaws).\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Flaws**\n1. **Clock Cycle Misinterpretations**:\n   - `ack_after_request` assumes fixed 2-cycle latency. If the core ever takes >1 cycle to respond (e.g., due to clock stretching), this assertion fails. The spec says \"each access takes 2 clock cycles,\" so this is acceptable but should be explicitly noted.\n   \n2. **Nested Conditions**:\n   - `arst_i == ARST_LVL` is repeated in every `disable iff`. This could be error-prone if `ARST_LVL` is redefined. Better to use a macro or parameter.\n\n3. **Missing Checks**:\n   - No assertion ensures `wb_ack_o` is **only** asserted for one cycle per request. A burst of acks could occur if the core malfunctions.\n   - No check for `wb_ack_o` during write cycles (e.g., `wb_we_i` high). The spec does not differentiate read/write for acks, but this could be an oversight.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Score**\n- **Correctness**: 70/100 (Flaws in latency, reset, and ack duration).\n- **Consistency**: 80/100 (Mostly aligns with spec but misses edge cases).\n- **Completeness**: 60/100 (Missing multi-cycle request handling, burst ack checks).\n- **Total**: **60/100** (Needs fixes for reset, ack duration, and multi-cycle cases).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. Fix `ack_one_cycle` using `|=> !wb_ack_o || (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i)`.\n2. Replace `ack_after_request` with a check for **exactly** 2-cycle latency if the spec mandates it.\n3. Add an assertion to prevent multiple acks per request.\n4. Use `always_comb` for asynchronous reset checks (non-SVA) if possible.\n5.

The original `ack_after_request` used `|=>`, which is correct, but to be explicit, using `##1` ensures the 2-cycle latency.\n3. **No Spurious Acks**: The previous check used `$past`, which works for single-cycle requests.

            [
                "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at the SVAs provided for wb_ack_o. The user wants me to critique them strictly, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, and clock cycle misinterpretations. Let's go through each assertion one by one.\n\nFirst, the \"ack_after_request\" property. It checks that after a valid request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i high), wb_ack_o asserts in the next cycle. But wait, the specification says each access takes two clock cycles. So the ack should come two cycles after the request, not one. This is a major flaw. The current assertion would fail because it's expecting the ack too early. That's a clock cycle misinterpretation.\n\nNext, \"ack_only_with_cyc\" ensures that ack is only high when cyc_i is active. That seems correct according to WISHBONE rules. But does it account for the possibility that cyc_i might drop in the same cycle as ack? The standard allows cyc_i to drop when ack is received, so maybe the assertion should check that cyc_i was active in the previous cycle when ack is asserted. Otherwise, there might be a false failure if cyc_i and ack drop simultaneously.\n\nThe \"no_spurious_ack\" property uses $past to check that a valid request occurred in the previous cycle. But if the request is sustained over multiple cycles, does this assertion handle that? Also, the specification mentions that each access takes two cycles. So the ack should come two cycles after the request, not one. This assertion is checking the wrong timing, similar to the first one. It's using $past(...,1) which is one cycle, but it should be two cycles. This is another clock cycle error.\n\nThen there's \"ack_deassert_unless_new_req\". The property says that if ack is high, then in the next cycle it should stay high only if there's a new request. But the way it's written might not handle back-to-back transactions correctly. Also, the syntax \"wb_ack_o |=> (wb_ack_o ? ...)\" could be simplified. Moreover, the specification says that each access takes two cycles, so consecutive acks might not be possible unless there's a pipelined request. The current assertion might not align with the two-cycle access rule, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nThe \"ack_reset\" property checks that during reset, ack is low. But the reset could be asynchronous (arst_i) or synchronous (wb_rst_i). The current assertion covers both, which is good. However, it doesn't check that ack remains low for the duration of the reset. If the reset is deasserted but then reasserted, does the assertion hold? Also, after reset deassertion, there might be a race condition if a request is made immediately. The assertion only checks the reset condition at the posedge, which is correct, but maybe there's a need to ensure that ack doesn't glitch during reset transitions.\n\nOther issues: The SVAs don't check the relationship between ack and the data signals (wb_dat_i, wb_dat_o). The specification mentions that all outputs are registered, so when ack is high, the data from the core (wb_dat_o) should be valid. There's no assertion ensuring that wb_dat_o is stable when ack is high. This is a completeness issue.\n\nAlso, the specification says that the core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with 2-cycle accesses. The current assertions don't verify that the ack occurs exactly two cycles after the request. They assume one cycle, which is incorrect. This is a major correctness issue across multiple properties.\n\nAnother point: The \"ack_deassert_unless_new_req\" property uses a ternary operator which might not be the clearest way to express the condition. It could be split into two separate properties for clarity. Additionally, the property might not handle the case where a new request starts in the same cycle as the ack is deasserting. There's a potential for overlapping transactions that aren't accounted for.\n\nLastly, there's no check for the maximum duration of ack. According to the spec, each access is two cycles, so ack should be high for exactly one cycle per request. The current assertions don't ensure that ack doesn't stay high longer than necessary, leading to possible protocol violations.\n\nIn summary, the main flaws are:\n1. Incorrect timing (1 cycle vs 2 cycles for ack).\n2. Missing checks for data validity with ack.\n3. Potential issues with back-to-back transactions and ack deassertion.\n4. No handling of the exact two-cycle access requirement.\n5. Possible oversights in reset behavior and signal stability.\n</think>\n\n**Critical Feedback on SVAs for `wb_ack_o`**  \n**Score: -65/100**  \n\n### **1. Clock Cycle Misinterpretation (Severe)**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **All assertions assume 1-cycle latency** between `wb_stb_i/wb_cyc_i` and `wb_ack_o`, but the specification explicitly states **2 clock cycles per access** (Section 2.2: \"Each access takes 2 clock cycles\").  \n  - Example: `ack_after_request` uses `|=>` (1-cycle delay), but it should use `|=> ##1 wb_ack_o`.  \n  - **Impact**: All timing-related assertions are fundamentally incorrect.  \n\n### **2. Incomplete Protocol Compliance**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **Missing check for `wb_ack_o` duration**: The spec requires `wb_ack_o` to pulse for **exactly 1 cycle per transaction**. No assertion ensures it doesn’t stay asserted for multiple cycles.  \n- **No data validity check**: When `wb_ack_o` is high, `wb_dat_o` (for reads) must be stable. Missing assertion:  \n  ```systemverilog\n  assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o));  \n  ```  \n\n### **3. Weak Reset Handling**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **Ignores asynchronous reset glitches**: The `ack_reset` property checks reset at the clock edge but doesn’t ensure `wb_ack_o` stays low **throughout** reset (e.g., during asynchronous reset transitions).  \n- **No recovery check**: Missing assertion to ensure `wb_ack_o` doesn’t assert prematurely after reset deassertion.  \n\n### **4. Back-to-Back Transaction Issues**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **`ack_deassert_unless_new_req` is ambiguous**:  \n  - Fails to account for the **2-cycle access rule** for consecutive transactions.  \n  - Incorrectly uses ternary operator (`wb_ack_o ? ...`), which doesn’t enforce strict deassertion after one cycle. Replace with:  \n    ```systemverilog\n    wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o // Must deassert after 1 cycle  \n    ```  \n\n### **5. Spurious Ack Check Incompleteness**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **`no_spurious_ack` uses `$past(...,1)`**: This assumes a 1-cycle request-to-ack latency, which violates the spec’s 2-cycle requirement. Correct version:  \n  ```systemverilog\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 2)  \n  ```  \n\n### **6. WISHBONE Rule Violations**  \n**Flaws**:  \n- **`ack_only_with_cyc` is too lenient**: It allows `wb_ack_o` to assert if `wb_cyc_i` drops in the same cycle (violates WISHBONE RevB.3). Strengthen with:  \n  ```systemverilog\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_cyc_i, 1)  \n  ```  \n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**  \n1. **Fix 2-Cycle Access Timing**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property ack_after_request;  \n     @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)  \n     (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;  \n   endproperty  \n   ```  \n2. **Add Data Stability Assertion**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o));  \n   ```  \n3. **Strengthen Reset Checks**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property ack_reset_holds;  \n     @(posedge wb_clk_i)  \n     (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> ##[0:$] !wb_ack_o;  \n   endproperty  \n   ```  \n4. **Enforce 1-Cycle Ack Pulse**:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $rose(wb_ack_o) |=> $fell(wb_ack_o));  \n   ```  \n\n**Final Score Adjustment**: **+35** after fixes.",

                "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `wb_ack_o` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. First, I need to recall the key points from the specification and the feedback given.\n\nFrom the specification, `wb_ack_o` is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a completed bus cycle. Each access takes two clock cycles. The previous feedback highlighted issues with timing (using 1 cycle instead of 2), missing data validity checks, and incomplete reset handling.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. Since `wb_ack_o` is defined as 1-bit, a simple check using `$bits` is needed. However, in SystemVerilog, `$bits` is a compile-time function, so a static assertion isn't necessary. But to be thorough, maybe include a comment about the width, though it's not a runtime check.\n\nNext, connectivity. The WISHBONE interface requires that `wb_ack_o` asserts exactly two cycles after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are both high. The previous assertion used `|=>`, which is a one-cycle delay, but the correct delay is two cycles. So, the property should use `##1` to add another cycle, making it `|=> ##1 wb_ack_o`.\n\nFor functionality, ensuring that `wb_ack_o` is only high for one cycle per transaction is crucial. The previous attempt had a property that tried to handle deassertion but used a ternary operator, which was confusing. A better approach is to assert that once `wb_ack_o` rises, it must fall on the next cycle, ensuring a single-cycle pulse.\n\nAnother functionality point is checking that `wb_ack_o` only follows a valid request. The original assertion used `$past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1)`, but since the ack comes two cycles later, it should be `$past(..., 2)` instead.\n\nReset handling needs to ensure that during any reset (asynchronous or synchronous), `wb_ack_o` remains low. Also, after reset, the signal shouldn't glitch. The assertion should check that whenever reset is active, `wb_ack_o` is low, not just at the clock edge but throughout the reset period.\n\nData validity is another aspect. When `wb_ack_o` is high, the data on `wb_dat_o` should be valid and stable. An assertion should check that `wb_dat_o` isn't unknown (X or Z) when `wb_ack_o` is high.\n\nBack-to-back transactions need consideration. If a new request starts immediately after an ack, the two-cycle rule still applies. The ack from the first transaction should deassert, and the new ack should come two cycles after the new request.\n\nPutting this all together, the SVAs should cover:\n\n1. Correct two-cycle delay from request to ack.\n2. Ack only when `wb_cyc_i` was active in the previous cycle.\n3. No spurious acks without a prior request.\n4. Ack deasserts after one cycle.\n5. Reset conditions keep ack low.\n6. Data validity when ack is high.\n\nEach of these points translates into specific properties. Now, structuring them properly while avoiding syntax errors and adhering to the spec is key. Also, ensuring that all feedback points are addressed, especially the timing correction from one cycle to two cycles.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] - Static check (wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit)\n// No runtime assertion needed for fixed-width signals\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts exactly 2 cycles after valid request\nproperty ack_timing;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i was active in previous cycle\nproperty ack_cyc_relationship;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_cyc_relationship);\n\n// [Functionality] Single-cycle ack pulse\nproperty ack_pulse_width;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  $rose(wb_ack_o) |=> $fell(wb_ack_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_pulse_width);\n\n// [Functionality] Valid data with ack\nproperty ack_data_valid;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_data_valid);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset clears ack persistently\nproperty ack_reset_behavior;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> ##[0:$] !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset_behavior);\n\n// [Functionality] No ack without prior request\nproperty ack_causality;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 2);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_causality);\n``` \n\n**Key Improvements from Feedback**:\n1. **2-Cycle Timing**: Fixed with `|=> ##1` to match spec's 2-cycle access\n2. **Data Validity**: Added check for stable `wb_dat_o` during ack\n3. **Reset Robustness**: Used `##[0:$]` to cover entire reset duration\n4. **Protocol Compliance**: Enforced single-cycle ack pulse and WISHBONE cyc_i rules\n5. **Causality Check**: Uses `$past(...,2)` for correct request-ack timing"

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2.

So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit.

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specifications and the feedback from the previous attempt. Let's start by reviewing the requirements and the issues identified in the prior version.\n\nFirst, the width assertion is straightforward—wb_ack_o is a 1-bit signal, so checking its width is essential. That part is correct and doesn't need changes.\n\nNext, connectivity. The previous assertion checked that wb_ack_o asserts one cycle after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high. The feedback mentioned that this might not account for back-to-back transactions. However, according to the WISHBONE spec, each access takes two cycles, so the ack should come exactly one cycle after the request. The original assertion is correct, but the feedback suggested that the ack_one_cycle assertion was too restrictive. The fix was to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present. So I need to adjust the ack_one_cycle property to handle consecutive transactions.\n\nThen, the functionality checks. The previous version missed checking for spurious acks (ack without a prior request) and data validity during read operations. Also, the reset check didn't account for asynchronous resets properly.\n\nFor the reset condition, the original assertion checked that during reset, ack is low. However, asynchronous resets can occur at any time, not just clock edges. The feedback suggested adding an always block to check asynchronous resets, but SVAs are synchronous. So perhaps using a concurrent assertion with $inferred_clock might help, but it's tricky. Alternatively, rely on the disable iff clause to handle resets.\n\nThe data validity check for reads wasn't in the original SVAs. The user's specification mentions that wb_dat_o is valid when ack is high during a read, so adding that is necessary.\n\nPutting this all together, here's the plan:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: Keep as is.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - Ack asserts one cycle after request.\n   - Ack only when cyc_i is active.\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - Ack deasserts after one cycle unless a new request starts.\n   - No ack during reset (sync or async).\n   - No spurious acks (ack only after request).\n   - Data validity during read acks.\n\nNow, implementing these with the fixes from the feedback:\n\n- For back-to-back transactions, modify the ack_one_cycle property to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present.\n- Add a spurious ack check using $past.\n- Add data validity check for reads.\n- Ensure reset checks cover both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.\n\nTesting for syntax and correctness, ensuring no new signals are introduced and all assertions align with the spec.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] Check signal width using $bits\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request (WISHBONE 2-cycle rule)\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i is active (WISHBONE protocol)\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\n// [Functionality] No spurious acks (ack only after valid request)\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_spurious_ack);\n\n// [Functionality] Ack duration (1 cycle unless back-to-back request)\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset condition (sync/async)\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\n// [Functionality] Data validity during read acks\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (data_valid_on_ack);\n```": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low.

But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high.

So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle.

        "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle generating the SVAs for `wb_ack_o` again, incorporating the feedback and ensuring all syntax and semantic issues are addressed. \n\nFirst, I'll start by revisiting the specifications and the previous errors. The main issues were around the `ack_one_cycle` property misusing `throughout`, the reset condition not handling asynchronous resets properly, and missing checks for multi-cycle requests and burst acks.\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: Straightforward, no changes needed here.\n2. **Connectivity - Ack Timing**: The spec says each access takes 2 cycles, so the ack should come exactly one cycle after the request. The original `ack_after_request` used `|=>`, which is correct, but to be explicit, using `##1` ensures the 2-cycle latency.\n3. **No Spurious Acks**: The previous check used `$past`, which works for single-cycle requests. For multi-cycle, adding `throughout wb_cyc_i[*1:$]` ensures the request was active at least once in the past cycles.\n4. **Ack Duration**: The corrected `ack_one_cycle` now allows ack to persist if a new request is present, using logical OR.\n5. **Reset Handling**: Split into synchronous and asynchronous checks. The synchronous part uses `disable iff`, and an `always` block handles async resets (though non-synthesizable, it's a simulation check).\n6. **Data Validity**: Already correct, no changes.\n7. **Single Ack Per Request**: Added a new assertion to prevent multiple acks per request using `|-> ##[1:2] wb_ack_o [->1]`.\n\nI also need to ensure all assertions are segregated into width, connectivity, and functionality sections as per the user's latest instruction.

X-check on read data ensures interface reliability": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specifications and the feedback from the previous attempt. Let's start by reviewing the requirements and the issues identified in the prior version.\n\nFirst, the width assertion is straightforward—wb_ack_o is a 1-bit signal, so checking its width is essential. That part is correct and doesn't need changes.\n\nNext, connectivity. The previous assertion checked that wb_ack_o asserts one cycle after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high. The feedback mentioned that this might not account for back-to-back transactions. However, according to the WISHBONE spec, each access takes two cycles, so the ack should come exactly one cycle after the request. The original assertion is correct, but the feedback suggested that the ack_one_cycle assertion was too restrictive. The fix was to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present. So I need to adjust the ack_one_cycle property to handle consecutive transactions.\n\nThen, the functionality checks. The previous version missed checking for spurious acks (ack without a prior request) and data validity during read operations. Also, the reset check didn't account for asynchronous resets properly.\n\nFor the reset condition, the original assertion checked that during reset, ack is low. However, asynchronous resets can occur at any time, not just clock edges. The feedback suggested adding an always block to check asynchronous resets, but SVAs are synchronous. So perhaps using a concurrent assertion with $inferred_clock might help, but it's tricky. Alternatively, rely on the disable iff clause to handle resets.\n\nThe data validity check for reads wasn't in the original SVAs. The user's specification mentions that wb_dat_o is valid when ack is high during a read, so adding that is necessary.\n\nPutting this all together, here's the plan:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: Keep as is.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - Ack asserts one cycle after request.\n   - Ack only when cyc_i is active.\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - Ack deasserts after one cycle unless a new request starts.\n   - No ack during reset (sync or async).\n   - No spurious acks (ack only after request).\n   - Data validity during read acks.\n\nNow, implementing these with the fixes from the feedback:\n\n- For back-to-back transactions, modify the ack_one_cycle property to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present.\n- Add a spurious ack check using $past.\n- Add data validity check for reads.\n- Ensure reset checks cover both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.\n\nTesting for syntax and correctness, ensuring no new signals are introduced and all assertions align with the spec.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] Check signal width using $bits\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request (WISHBONE 2-cycle rule)\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i is active (WISHBONE protocol)\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\n// [Functionality] No spurious acks (ack only after valid request)\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_spurious_ack);\n\n// [Functionality] Ack duration (1 cycle unless back-to-back request)\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset condition (sync/async)\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\n// [Functionality] Data validity during read acks\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (data_valid_on_ack);\n```",

Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit. Use `$bits` to verify.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - WISHBONE requires `wb_ack_o` to assert **exactly one cycle** after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high (2-cycle access).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only be high when `wb_cyc_i` is active (WISHBONE rule).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_ack_o` must **never** assert during reset (sync or async).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must deassert after one cycle unless a new request occurs.\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only follow valid requests (no spurious acks).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check with `$bits`.\n- **Timing**: Use overlapping implication to ensure ack follows request.\n- **Reset**: Check ack is low during reset.\n- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure ack aligns with WISHBONE standards.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// Functionality: Ack only when cyc_i is active\nproperty ack_only_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_with_cyc);\n\n// Functionality: Ack deasserts after one cycle\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// Reset condition: Ack never asserted during reset\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n```",
        "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `wb_ack_o` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. First, I need to recall the key points from the specification and the feedback given.\n\nFrom the specification, `wb_ack_o` is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a completed bus cycle. Each access takes two clock cycles. The previous feedback highlighted issues with timing (using 1 cycle instead of 2), missing data validity checks, and incomplete reset handling.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. Since `wb_ack_o` is defined as 1-bit, a simple check using `$bits` is needed. However, in SystemVerilog, `$bits` is a compile-time function, so a static assertion isn't necessary. But to be thorough, maybe include a comment about the width, though it's not a runtime check.\n\nNext, connectivity. The WISHBONE interface requires that `wb_ack_o` asserts exactly two cycles after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are both high. The previous assertion used `|=>`, which is a one-cycle delay, but the correct delay is two cycles. So, the property should use `##1` to add another cycle, making it `|=> ##1 wb_ack_o`.\n\nFor functionality, ensuring that `wb_ack_o` is only high for one cycle per transaction is crucial. The previous attempt had a property that tried to handle deassertion but used a ternary operator, which was confusing. A better approach is to assert that once `wb_ack_o` rises, it must fall on the next cycle, ensuring a single-cycle pulse.\n\nAnother functionality point is checking that `wb_ack_o` only follows a valid request. The original assertion used `$past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1)`, but since the ack comes two cycles later, it should be `$past(..., 2)` instead.\n\nReset handling needs to ensure that during any reset (asynchronous or synchronous), `wb_ack_o` remains low. Also, after reset, the signal shouldn't glitch. The assertion should check that whenever reset is active, `wb_ack_o` is low, not just at the clock edge but throughout the reset period.\n\nData validity is another aspect. When `wb_ack_o` is high, the data on `wb_dat_o` should be valid and stable. An assertion should check that `wb_dat_o` isn't unknown (X or Z) when `wb_ack_o` is high.\n\nBack-to-back transactions need consideration. If a new request starts immediately after an ack, the two-cycle rule still applies. The ack from the first transaction should deassert, and the new ack should come two cycles after the new request.\n\nPutting this all together, the SVAs should cover:\n\n1. Correct two-cycle delay from request to ack.\n2. Ack only when `wb_cyc_i` was active in the previous cycle.\n3. No spurious acks without a prior request.\n4. Ack deasserts after one cycle.\n5. Reset conditions keep ack low.\n6. Data validity when ack is high.\n\nEach of these points translates into specific properties. Now, structuring them properly while avoiding syntax errors and adhering to the spec is key.

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit. Use `$bits` to verify.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - WISHBONE requires `wb_ack_o` to assert **exactly one cycle** after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high (2-cycle access).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only be high when `wb_cyc_i` is active (WISHBONE rule).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_ack_o` must **never** assert during reset (sync or async).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must deassert after one cycle unless a new request occurs.\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only follow valid requests (no spurious acks).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check with `$bits`.\n- **Timing**: Use overlapping implication to ensure ack follows request.\n- **Reset**: Check ack is low during reset.\n- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure ack aligns with WISHBONE standards.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// Functionality: Ack only when cyc_i is active\nproperty ack_only_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_with_cyc);\n\n// Functionality: Ack deasserts after one cycle\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// Reset condition: Ack never asserted during reset\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n```": [

            "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `wb_ack_o` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. First, I need to recall the key points from the specification and the feedback given.\n\nFrom the specification, `wb_ack_o` is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a completed bus cycle. Each access takes two clock cycles. The previous feedback highlighted issues with timing (using 1 cycle instead of 2), missing data validity checks, and incomplete reset handling.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. Since `wb_ack_o` is defined as 1-bit, a simple check using `$bits` is needed. However, in SystemVerilog, `$bits` is a compile-time function, so a static assertion isn't necessary. But to be thorough, maybe include a comment about the width, though it's not a runtime check.\n\nNext, connectivity. The WISHBONE interface requires that `wb_ack_o` asserts exactly two cycles after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are both high. The previous assertion used `|=>`, which is a one-cycle delay, but the correct delay is two cycles. So, the property should use `##1` to add another cycle, making it `|=> ##1 wb_ack_o`.\n\nFor functionality, ensuring that `wb_ack_o` is only high for one cycle per transaction is crucial. The previous attempt had a property that tried to handle deassertion but used a ternary operator, which was confusing. A better approach is to assert that once `wb_ack_o` rises, it must fall on the next cycle, ensuring a single-cycle pulse.\n\nAnother functionality point is checking that `wb_ack_o` only follows a valid request. The original assertion used `$past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1)`, but since the ack comes two cycles later, it should be `$past(..., 2)` instead.\n\nReset handling needs to ensure that during any reset (asynchronous or synchronous), `wb_ack_o` remains low. Also, after reset, the signal shouldn't glitch. The assertion should check that whenever reset is active, `wb_ack_o` is low, not just at the clock edge but throughout the reset period.\n\nData validity is another aspect. When `wb_ack_o` is high, the data on `wb_dat_o` should be valid and stable. An assertion should check that `wb_dat_o` isn't unknown (X or Z) when `wb_ack_o` is high.\n\nBack-to-back transactions need consideration. If a new request starts immediately after an ack, the two-cycle rule still applies. The ack from the first transaction should deassert, and the new ack should come two cycles after the new request.\n\nPutting this all together, the SVAs should cover:\n\n1. Correct two-cycle delay from request to ack.\n2. Ack only when `wb_cyc_i` was active in the previous cycle.\n3. No spurious acks without a prior request.\n4. Ack deasserts after one cycle.\n5. Reset conditions keep ack low.\n6. Data validity when ack is high.\n\nEach of these points translates into specific properties.

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_ack_o.\n\nFrom the description, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle. It's part of the WISHBONE interface. The core uses a WISHBONE Classic interface with each access taking 2 clock cycles. The key points here are that wb_ack_o should assert after a valid transaction and follow the WISHBONE protocol.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since it's a 1-bit signal, the width check is straightforward. We can use $bits to confirm it's 1 bit wide.\n\nNext, connectivity. wb_ack_o is part of the WISHBONE interface, so it should only be asserted when there's a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high). Also, according to the spec, each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), wb_ack_o should assert on the next cycle. But wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the strobe is asserted. Need to model that.\n\nFor functionality, we need to ensure that wb_ack_o is only high when a valid transaction is completed. Also, it shouldn't be asserted during reset. Since the core uses either wb_rst_i (synchronous) or arst_i (asynchronous), we need to check that during reset, ack is low.\n\nAnother point: WISHBONE requires that ack is only asserted in response to a valid strobe and cycle. So, wb_ack_o should only be high if wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are also high. Also, ack should not be asserted without a prior request.\n\nAlso, since the core's outputs are registered, wb_ack_o should be asserted exactly one cycle after the address phase. Let's think: the WISHBONE Classic cycle with 2 cycles per access. The first cycle is the address phase (wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc.), and the second is the data phase where ack is asserted. So, when a valid transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), then in the next cycle, wb_ack_o should be high, and then in the following cycle, it should go low unless another transaction is ongoing.\n\nWait, but the spec says each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, when a read or write is initiated, the ack comes on the second cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high (address phase).\nCycle 2: wb_ack_o is high (data phase), and data is transferred.\n\nSo, the assertion would check that after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycle, wb_ack_o is high. Also, once ack is high, it should deassert unless another transaction starts immediately.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_ack_o should be low. The asynchronous reset level is set by ARST_LVL parameter, but the user provided parameters are already in the code, so maybe we can use the existing reset signals.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_ack_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that ack is only asserted when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, and that it follows the 2-cycle rule.\n\nFunctionality: Check that ack doesn't stay high for more than one cycle unless another transaction starts, and that it's not asserted during reset.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: After a valid strobe and cycle, ack should assert in the next cycle.\n\nproperty ack_timing;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So maybe the ack comes on the second cycle after the start. Wait, the address phase is one cycle, then the data phase (ack) is the next. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, the next cycle should have ack high. So |=> wb_ack_o would mean one cycle later. But maybe the ack is generated in the same cycle as the address phase? No, because the core's outputs are registered. So the ack would come one cycle after the address phase.\n\nAnother point: The ack should only be high for one cycle per transaction. So after ack is high, it should go low unless a new transaction starts.\n\nAlso, ack should not be asserted without a prior request. So, whenever ack is high, there must have been a request (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i) in the previous cycle.\n\nAnother functionality check: When ack is high, the data should be valid. For reads, wb_dat_o should have valid data when ack is high. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nAlso, during reset, ack should be low. So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\nBut since arst_i is asynchronous, maybe we need to check that upon reset assertion, ack is low. However, SVAs are synchronous, so perhaps checking that during reset, ack remains low.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nWidth: Check 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity: ack asserts one cycle after valid strobe and cycle.\n\nFunctionality: ack is only high when there was a request, and only for one cycle. Also, no ack during reset.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\n1. Width:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n\nproperty valid_ack;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_ack);\n\nBut wait, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come exactly one cycle after the strobe and cycle are asserted. So the above property checks that.\n\n3. Functionality: ack is high only if there was a request in the previous cycle.\n\nproperty ack_only_after_request;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_after_request);\n\n4. Ack duration: Once ack is high, it should not stay high unless another request is made.\n\nBut since each access is 2 cycles, ack should be high for only one cycle. So:\n\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n5. Reset condition: During reset, ack is low.\n\nproperty ack_reset;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\nBut need to handle asynchronous reset. However, in SVAs, disable iff is used to disable during reset. But the assertion here checks that during reset, ack is low.\n\nWait, the core has two resets: arst_i (async) and wb_rst_i (sync). The parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So when either reset is active, ack should be low.\n\nSo the reset assertion would check that whenever arst_i is at its active level (ARST_LVL) or wb_rst_i is high, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nBut in SVAs, checking during reset might need to consider the reset condition. However, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use ARST_LVL as a localparam.\n\nPutting all these together, the SVAs for wb_ack_o would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Assertion that ack is high one cycle after valid request\n- Ack only occurs after a request\n- Ack is high for only one cycle\n- Ack is low during reset\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness. For example, using |=> for the next cycle, and $past for the previous cycle.\n\nAlso, the disable iff clause should cover both resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, but in the properties, we are using posedge wb_clk_i, so the disable iff would handle both resets.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE spec requires that ack is only asserted when both cyc and stb are high. So the ack should not be asserted if cyc or stb are low. So another assertion could be that whenever ack is high, cyc and stb are also high. But according to the WISHBONE standard, ack can be asserted in the same cycle as cyc and stb are high. However, in this core's case, since the ack is registered, it's possible that stb and cyc might have been deasserted in the cycle when ack is high. Wait, no. Because the core's access takes two cycles. So in the first cycle, stb and cyc are high; in the second cycle, ack is high. But stb and cyc might still be high if it's a multi-cycle transaction. However, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So for single transfers, stb and cyc are high for one cycle, then ack is high in the next. But for pipelined transactions, maybe stb and cyc stay high. However, the user hasn't specified pipelined support. The core uses the WISHBONE Classic interface, which is non-pipelined. So each transaction is two cycles: address phase (stb and cyc high), then data phase (ack high). So in the data phase, stb and cyc may still be high. But according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high. So the assertion could check that when ack is high, cyc is also high.\n\nSo another assertion:\n\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n   @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n   wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\nBecause according to WISHBONE, ack is only valid when cyc is high.\n\nSimilarly, stb may not necessarily be high when ack is asserted, because stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. For example:\n\nCycle 1: stb and cyc high\nCycle 2: ack high, stb low, cyc high (if it's the end of the cycle)\n\nBut according to WISHBONE, stb can be deasserted after the first cycle. However, the core's spec says each access takes two cycles. So in the second cycle, stb may still be high. But I'm not sure. The WISHBONE spec allows for stb to be high for only one cycle, even if cyc remains high for multiple transfers. However, in this core's case, since each access is two cycles, perhaps stb is high for one cycle, and cyc is high for two cycles. But the user hasn't provided detailed timing on that.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps it's safer to include the assertion that when ack is high, cyc is also high, as per WISHBONE rules.\n\nSo adding that as another connectivity assertion.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. ack asserts one cycle after stb and cyc.\n3. ack only if previous cycle had stb and cyc.\n4. ack is high for one cycle.\n5. ack is low during reset.\n6. ack only when cyc is high.\n\nNow, compiling these into SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit. Use `$bits` to verify.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - WISHBONE requires `wb_ack_o` to assert **exactly one cycle** after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are high (2-cycle access).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only be high when `wb_cyc_i` is active (WISHBONE rule).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_ack_o` must **never** assert during reset (sync or async).\n   - `wb_ack_o` must deassert after one cycle unless a new request occurs.\n   - `wb_ack_o` must only follow valid requests (no spurious acks).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check with `$bits`.\n- **Timing**: Use overlapping implication to ensure ack follows request.\n- **Reset**: Check ack is low during reset.\n- **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure ack aligns with WISHBONE standards.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// Functionality: Ack only when cyc_i is active\nproperty ack_only_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_only_with_cyc);\n\n// Functionality: Ack deasserts after one cycle\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// Reset condition: Ack never asserted during reset\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n```": -20.25,
        "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the signal wb_ack_o based on the provided specifications and the feedback from the previous attempt. Let's start by reviewing the requirements and the issues identified in the prior version.\n\nFirst, the width assertion is straightforward—wb_ack_o is a 1-bit signal, so checking its width is essential. That part is correct and doesn't need changes.\n\nNext, connectivity. The previous assertion checked that wb_ack_o asserts one cycle after wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high. The feedback mentioned that this might not account for back-to-back transactions. However, according to the WISHBONE spec, each access takes two cycles, so the ack should come exactly one cycle after the request. The original assertion is correct, but the feedback suggested that the ack_one_cycle assertion was too restrictive. The fix was to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present. So I need to adjust the ack_one_cycle property to handle consecutive transactions.\n\nThen, the functionality checks. The previous version missed checking for spurious acks (ack without a prior request) and data validity during read operations. Also, the reset check didn't account for asynchronous resets properly.\n\nFor the reset condition, the original assertion checked that during reset, ack is low. However, asynchronous resets can occur at any time, not just clock edges. The feedback suggested adding an always block to check asynchronous resets, but SVAs are synchronous. So perhaps using a concurrent assertion with $inferred_clock might help, but it's tricky. Alternatively, rely on the disable iff clause to handle resets.\n\nThe data validity check for reads wasn't in the original SVAs. The user's specification mentions that wb_dat_o is valid when ack is high during a read, so adding that is necessary.\n\nPutting this all together, here's the plan:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: Keep as is.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - Ack asserts one cycle after request.\n   - Ack only when cyc_i is active.\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - Ack deasserts after one cycle unless a new request starts.\n   - No ack during reset (sync or async).\n   - No spurious acks (ack only after request).\n   - Data validity during read acks.\n\nNow, implementing these with the fixes from the feedback:\n\n- For back-to-back transactions, modify the ack_one_cycle property to allow ack to stay high if a new request is present.\n- Add a spurious ack check using $past.\n- Add data validity check for reads.\n- Ensure reset checks cover both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.\n\nTesting for syntax and correctness, ensuring no new signals are introduced and all assertions align with the spec.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] Check signal width using $bits\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts 1 cycle after valid request (WISHBONE 2-cycle rule)\nproperty ack_after_request;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_after_request);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i is active (WISHBONE protocol)\nproperty ack_with_cyc;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_with_cyc);\n\n// [Functionality] No spurious acks (ack only after valid request)\nproperty no_spurious_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (no_spurious_ack);\n\n// [Functionality] Ack duration (1 cycle unless back-to-back request)\nproperty ack_one_cycle;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_one_cycle);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset condition (sync/async)\nproperty ack_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset);\n\n// [Functionality] Data validity during read acks\nproperty data_valid_on_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (data_valid_on_ack);\n```": -31.084426458309434,

The original `ack_after_request` used `|=>`, which is correct, but to be explicit, using `##1` ensures the 2-cycle latency.\n3. **No Spurious Acks**: The previous check used `$past`, which works for single-cycle requests. For multi-cycle, adding `throughout wb_cyc_i[*1:$]` ensures the request was active at least once in the past cycles.\n4. **Ack Duration**: The corrected `ack_one_cycle` now allows ack to persist if a new request is present, using logical OR.\n5. **Reset Handling**: Split into synchronous and asynchronous checks. The synchronous part uses `disable iff`, and an `always` block handles async resets (though non-synthesizable, it's a simulation check).\n6. **Data Validity**: Already correct, no changes.\n7. **Single Ack Per Request**: Added a new assertion to prevent multiple acks per request using `|-> ##[1:2] wb_ack_o [->1]`.\n\nI also need to ensure all assertions are segregated into width, connectivity, and functionality sections as per the user's latest instruction.

        "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `wb_ack_o` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. First, I need to recall the key points from the specification and the feedback given.\n\nFrom the specification, `wb_ack_o` is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a completed bus cycle. Each access takes two clock cycles. The previous feedback highlighted issues with timing (using 1 cycle instead of 2), missing data validity checks, and incomplete reset handling.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. Since `wb_ack_o` is defined as 1-bit, a simple check using `$bits` is needed. However, in SystemVerilog, `$bits` is a compile-time function, so a static assertion isn't necessary. But to be thorough, maybe include a comment about the width, though it's not a runtime check.\n\nNext, connectivity. The WISHBONE interface requires that `wb_ack_o` asserts exactly two cycles after `wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` are both high. The previous assertion used `|=>`, which is a one-cycle delay, but the correct delay is two cycles. So, the property should use `##1` to add another cycle, making it `|=> ##1 wb_ack_o`.\n\nFor functionality, ensuring that `wb_ack_o` is only high for one cycle per transaction is crucial. The previous attempt had a property that tried to handle deassertion but used a ternary operator, which was confusing. A better approach is to assert that once `wb_ack_o` rises, it must fall on the next cycle, ensuring a single-cycle pulse.\n\nAnother functionality point is checking that `wb_ack_o` only follows a valid request. The original assertion used `$past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1)`, but since the ack comes two cycles later, it should be `$past(..., 2)` instead.\n\nReset handling needs to ensure that during any reset (asynchronous or synchronous), `wb_ack_o` remains low. Also, after reset, the signal shouldn't glitch. The assertion should check that whenever reset is active, `wb_ack_o` is low, not just at the clock edge but throughout the reset period.\n\nData validity is another aspect. When `wb_ack_o` is high, the data on `wb_dat_o` should be valid and stable. An assertion should check that `wb_dat_o` isn't unknown (X or Z) when `wb_ack_o` is high.\n\nBack-to-back transactions need consideration. If a new request starts immediately after an ack, the two-cycle rule still applies. The ack from the first transaction should deassert, and the new ack should come two cycles after the new request.\n\nPutting this all together, the SVAs should cover:\n\n1. Correct two-cycle delay from request to ack.\n2. Ack only when `wb_cyc_i` was active in the previous cycle.\n3. No spurious acks without a prior request.\n4. Ack deasserts after one cycle.\n5. Reset conditions keep ack low.\n6. Data validity when ack is high.\n\nEach of these points translates into specific properties. Now, structuring them properly while avoiding syntax errors and adhering to the spec is key. Also, ensuring that all feedback points are addressed, especially the timing correction from one cycle to two cycles.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// [Width] - Static check (wb_ack_o is defined as 1-bit)\n// No runtime assertion needed for fixed-width signals\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack asserts exactly 2 cycles after valid request\nproperty ack_timing;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_timing);\n\n// [Connectivity] Ack only when cyc_i was active in previous cycle\nproperty ack_cyc_relationship;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_cyc_i, 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_cyc_relationship);\n\n// [Functionality] Single-cycle ack pulse\nproperty ack_pulse_width;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  $rose(wb_ack_o) |=> $fell(wb_ack_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_pulse_width);\n\n// [Functionality] Valid data with ack\nproperty ack_data_valid;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_data_valid);\n\n// [Functionality] Reset clears ack persistently\nproperty ack_reset_behavior;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> ##[0:$] !wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_reset_behavior);\n\n// [Functionality] No ack without prior request\nproperty ack_causality;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 2);\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_causality);\n``` \n\n**Key Improvements from Feedback**:\n1. **2-Cycle Timing**: Fixed with `|=> ##1` to match spec's 2-cycle access\n2. **Data Validity**: Added check for stable `wb_dat_o` during ack\n3. **Reset Robustness**: Used `##[0:$]` to cover entire reset duration\n4. **Protocol Compliance**: Enforced single-cycle ack pulse and WISHBONE cyc_i rules\n5. **Causality Check**: Uses `$past(...,2)` for correct request-ack timing": 51.467398566581
