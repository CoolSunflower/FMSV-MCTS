Here is some more detailed information regarding the architecture:

Summary of Timer Module Architecture Workflow:

1. **Clock and Prescaler Inputs:**  
   - The `clk_fixed` input drives the `tick gen` block, which generates periodic tick signals.  
   - The `prescaler` input determines the frequency of the ticks by dividing the input clock.  
   - This setup allows flexible adjustment of the timer frequency based on the systems requirements.
2. **Tick Signal Generation:**  
   - The `tick gen` block outputs a `tick` signal for each hart (`tick[#Harts-1:0]`).  
   - Each tick represents a time unit for updating the `mtime` register.
3. **Incrementing mtime Register:**  
   - The `step` input provides a step value for incrementing the `mtime` register.  
   - When a tick is received, a multiplexer selects either the `step` value or zero.  
   - The selected value is added to the current `mtime` value through an adder.  
   - This approach supports both regular and custom step sizes, enhancing timer flexibility.
4. **mtime Comparison:**  
   - The updated `mtime` is compared with the `mtimecmp` comparator value.  
   - The `>=` comparator generates the `expired` signal when `mtime` meets or exceeds `mtimecmp`.  
   - This triggers the timer event, typically used for interrupt generation.
5. **Interrupt Signal (intr):**  
   - The `expired` signal drives the `intr` output, signaling the processor or system that the timer event occurred.  
   - The `intr` array supports multi-hart configurations, allowing each hart to handle its own timer interrupt.
6. **Control Flow and Flexibility:**  
   - The architecture supports dynamic configuration via `prescaler`, `step`, and `mtimecmp` values.  
   - The module can adapt to different timer intervals and application-specific timing requirements.  
Key Takeaways:
- The architecture provides a robust and configurable timer solution for multi-hart environments.  
- The `tick gen` with `prescaler` and `step` input combination allows fine-grained control over the timer frequency and increment size.  
- The `mtime` comparison logic ensures precise interrupt generation based on the `mtimecmp` value.'
