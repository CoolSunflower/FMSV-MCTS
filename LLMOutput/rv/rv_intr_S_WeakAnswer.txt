This module conforms to\n\nthe Comportable guideline for peripheral functionality. See that document for integration\n\noverview within the broader top level system.\n\nFeatures\n\ne 64-bit timer with 12-bit prescaler and 8-bit step register\ne Compliant with RISC-V privileged specification v1.11\ne Configurable number of timers per hart and number of harts\n\nDescription\n\nThe timer module provides a configurable number of 64-bit counters where each counter\nincrements by a step value whenever the prescaler times out. Each timer generates an\ninterrupt if the counter reaches (or is above) a programmed value. The timer is intended to\nbe used by the processors to check the current time relative to the reset or the system\npower-on.\n\nIn this version, the timer doesn’t consider low-power modes and assumes the clock is\nneither turned off nor changed during runtime.\n\nCompatibility\nThe timer IP provides memory-mapped registers equivalent to mtime and mtimecmp which\ncan be used as the machine-mode timer registers defined in the RISC-V privileged spec.\n\nAdditional features such as prescaler, step, and a configurable number of timers and harts\nhave been added.\n\nTheory of Operation\n\nBlock Diagram\n\nclk_fixed expired\n\ntick[#Harts-1:0]\n\ntick gen :\n\nThe timer module is composed of tick generators, counters, and comparators. A tick\ngenerator creates a tick every time its internal counter hits the CFG@.prescaler value. The\ntick is used to increment mtime by the CFG@.step value. The 64-bit mtime value is\ncompared with the 64-bit mtimecmp. If mtime is greater than or equal to mtimecmp, the\ntimer raises an interrupt.\n\nmtimecmp\nprescaler\n\nDesign Details\n\nTick Generator\n\nThe tick module inside the timer IP is used to generate a fixed period of pulse signal. This\nallows creation of a call-clock timer tick such as 1us or 10us regardless of the system clock\nperiod. It is useful if the system has more than one clock as a clock source. The firmware\njust needs to adjust the CFG@.prescaler value and the actual timer interrupt handling\nroutine does not need a variable clock period to update mt imecmp.\n\nFor instance, if a system switches between 48MHz and 200MHz clocks, a prescaler value of\n47 for 48MHz and 199 for 200MHz will generate a 1us tick. In this version, the timer only\nsupports a single fixed clock, so the firmware should change CFG@.prescaler\nappropriately.\n\nConfigurable number of timers and harts\n\nThe timer IP supports more than one HART and/or more than one timer per hart. Each hart\nhas a set of tick generator and counter. It means the timer IP has the same number of\nprescalers, steps, and mtime registers as the number of harts.\n\nEach hart can have multiple sets of mt imecmp, comparator logic, and expire interrupt\nsignals.

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, I need to generate SVAs for the 'intr' signal based on the provided specifications. Let's start by understanding the requirements.

First, the signal 'intr' is an output array whose width depends on the number of harts. The current version has one hart, so it's a single bit. The functionality is that an interrupt is asserted when mtime >= mtimecmp. Also, the interrupt should deassert when mtime is less than mtimecmp after being set. 

For width assertion, since it's an array but currently one hart, I should check that each bit in 'intr' is 1-bit. But the user says the array size depends on the number of harts. Wait, the problem states that in the current version, it's fixed to one hart and one timer, so maybe 'intr' is 1-bit. But the spec says it's an N-bit array. However, the exact parameter isn't given. Since the user says not to create new signals, maybe use a localparam for N_HARTS. But the user mentioned parameters are already added, so perhaps assume N_HARTS is defined. The width check would be that each element is 1-bit. Wait, the 'intr' is an array of N bits, each being a single interrupt. So the width of each element is 1, and the array size is N_HARTS. But the width assertion for 'intr' would check that each bit is 1. So for each hart, the interrupt is a single bit. So the assertion would check $bits(intr[i]) == 1 for each i. But since the user says the current version has one hart, maybe the array is size 1. But the spec says it's configurable. Hmm. The width assertion for 'intr' should check that each element is 1-bit. So using a generate loop for each hart.

Next, connectivity. The 'intr' should be driven by the comparison between mtime and mtimecmp. So when mtime >= mtimecmp, intr is high. Also, when the comparison is false, intr should be low. So connectivity checks would ensure that the interrupt is correctly reflecting the comparison. Also, considering reset: when reset is active, intr should be low.

Functionality: The main function is that intr asserts when mtime >= mtimecmp and deasserts otherwise. Also, after a tick occurs (which increments mtime by step), the comparison should be checked. But the tick affects mtime, which in turn affects the comparison. So the assertion should check that whenever mtime >= mtimecmp, intr is high, and when it's not, intr is low. Also, after reset, intr should be low.

Additional considerations: The interrupt should stay asserted until mtimecmp is updated or mtime is modified. But according to the spec, the interrupt is generated when mtime >= mtimecmp. So once mtime is >=, the interrupt remains high until mtime becomes less than mtimecmp (which would require changing mtimecmp or mtime). But in normal operation, mtime increments, so once it's >=, it stays >= unless mtimecmp is updated. However, the SVA should check that whenever the condition is met, intr is high, and when not met, it's low.

Possible assertions:

1. Width: Each element of intr is 1-bit. Since it's an array, check each bit's width. But in SystemVerilog, $bits(intr[i]) would be 1 for each i. So generate a loop for each hart.

2. Connectivity: Check that intr is driven by the comparison. So, for each hart, intr[i] == (mtime >= mtimecmp[i]). But need to consider the reset condition. When reset is active, intr should be 0.

3. Functionality: After reset, intr is 0. When mtime >= mtimecmp, intr asserts. Also, when mtime < mtimecmp, intr deasserts. Also, check that when the comparison changes, the intr updates accordingly on the next clock edge.

Also, the 'intr' is an output, so it should be driven combinationally based on mtime and mtimecmp. So the assertion should check that whenever the comparison result changes, the intr signal reflects it in the same cycle or the next? Since it's a synchronous design, likely the comparison is done on the clock edge, so the intr would change at the next posedge. Wait, but the mtime is a register that updates on the clock. So when mtime changes, the comparison result changes, and intr should update accordingly. So the assertion should check that at each clock edge, the intr is equal to the comparison result from the current mtime and mtimecmp.

But wait, mtime is a register. So mtime_d is the next value, and mtime is the current value. The comparison is based on the current mtime. So the intr should be based on the current mtime, not the next. So the assertion would be that at any posedge clk_i, if not in reset, then intr[i] == (mtime >= mtimecmp[i]).

But also, during reset, intr should be 0. So when reset is low (active), intr is 0. When reset is inactive, then the comparison holds.

Putting it all together:

Width assertion: For each hart, check that the intr bit is 1-bit. Using generate loop.

Connectivity: Check that intr is driven by the comparison, considering reset.

Functionality: Check that when not in reset, intr reflects the comparison. Also, check that after reset, intr is 0.

Possible SVAs:

- Width: Using generate to loop through each hart and check each intr bit is 1-bit.

- Connectivity: Check that when not in reset, intr[i] is (mtime >= mtimecmp[i]).

- Reset check: When reset is active, intr is 0.

But wait, the reset is asynchronous. So during reset (rst_ni is 0), intr should be 0. So an assertion that checks that if rst_ni is low, then intr is 0.

Also, when coming out of reset, the intr should follow the comparison.

So the assertions would be:

1. Width: For each i in 0 to N_HARTS-1, check $bits(intr[i]) == 1.

2. Connectivity/Functionality: When not in reset, intr[i] == (mtime >= mtimecmp[i]).

3. Reset: If rst_ni is 0, then intr is 0.

But in SystemVerilog, the $bits function returns the total number of bits. Since each intr[i] is a single bit, $bits(intr[i]) is 1. So the width assertion is correct.

For the functionality, the assertion would be:

For each hart, if not in reset, then intr[i] should be equal to (mtime >= mtimecmp[i]).

But since the design is synchronous, the comparison is based on the current mtime value, and the intr is a registered output? Or is it combinational? The spec says "Directly driven by the comparison", implying combinational. So the intr should update immediately when mtime or mtimecmp changes, but in a synchronous system, the comparison would be sampled at the clock edge. Wait, the tick generator's output (tick) causes mtime to increment. The mtime is a register that updates on the clock edge. So mtime_d is the next value, and mtime is the current value. The comparison is between mtime (current) and mtimecmp, so the intr is a combinational function of these. Therefore, the intr should change as soon as mtime or mtimecmp changes, but in a synchronous system, these signals are registered, so their changes occur at clock edges. Therefore, the intr would be stable between clock edges. So the assertion should check that at every clock edge, the intr reflects the comparison of mtime and mtimecmp at that moment.

But in the code, if mtime and mtimecmp are registers, then their values are updated at the clock edge, and the comparison is done combinationally, so the intr would be valid in the same cycle. Therefore, the assertion can check that at the posedge clk_i, the intr is equal to the comparison of mtime and mtimecmp.

Wait, but the comparison is based on the current values of mtime and mtimecmp, which are the values before the clock edge. Because at the posedge, the registers update. So if mtime is a register, then at the posedge, the new value (mtime_d) becomes mtime. So the comparison for intr would be based on the new mtime value. Wait, no. Let me think: 

If mtime is a register that updates on the posedge of clk_i, then at the posedge, mtime becomes mtime_d. The comparison (mtime >= mtimecmp) would be based on the new mtime value. Therefore, the intr signal would be based on the new value. But the assertion is written to check at the posedge. So the property would be that at the posedge, after the update, the intr reflects the new comparison. But how is the intr generated? If it's combinational logic based on mtime and mtimecmp, then when mtime changes at the posedge, the intr would change after the propagation delay. But in SVAs, the properties are checked at the clock edge, assuming that the signals are stable. So the assertion would check that at the posedge, the intr is equal to the comparison of mtime and mtimecmp. But since mtime is updated at the posedge, the comparison is based on the new value. However, the intr is an output that depends on the current mtime and mtimecmp. Wait, maybe the intr is combinationally derived from mtime and mtimecmp, so when mtime changes at the posedge, the intr changes in the same cycle. But in the SVA, the check is at the posedge, so the values are sampled at the posedge. Therefore, the assertion should check that at the posedge, the intr is equal to (mtime >= mtimecmp). But since mtime is updated at the posedge, the comparison would be based on the previous value. Wait, no. Let's clarify:

At time t, posedge clk_i occurs. At this time, the registers (mtime) are updated with their next values (mtime_d). So after the posedge, mtime has the new value. The comparison (mtime >= mtimecmp) would use the new value. Therefore, the intr signal, being combinationally dependent on mtime and mtimecmp, would reflect the new comparison result immediately after the posedge. However, in the SVA, the property is checked at the posedge, which samples the values before the update. Wait, no. In SystemVerilog, the sampling of signals in assertions is done in the Preponed region, which is before the clock edge. So the values seen in the assertion are the values before the clock edge. Therefore, if mtime is updated at the posedge, the new value is not visible until the next clock cycle's Preponed region. Therefore, the comparison in the assertion would be based on the previous cycle's mtime value. But the intr signal is combinationally derived from mtime and mtimecmp. So if mtime is a register that updates at the posedge, then the new mtime value is available after the posedge. Therefore, the intr would change after the posedge, but the assertion sampled at the posedge would see the old value. Therefore, the assertion would need to check that in the next cycle, the intr reflects the new comparison. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think again.

Assume that mtime is a register that updates on the posedge of clk_i. So:

At time t, posedge clk_i occurs. mtime is updated to mtime_d (which was computed in the previous cycle). The comparison (mtime >= mtimecmp) is done combinationally using the new mtime value. Therefore, the intr signal would change to reflect this new comparison after the posedge. However, in the SVA, when we write:

assert property (@(posedge clk_i) (mtime >= mtimecmp) |-> intr);

This would check that at the posedge, if mtime (the new value) is >= mtimecmp, then intr is high. But since the SVA samples mtime and mtimecmp in the Preponed region (before the clock edge), the values would be the old ones. Therefore, this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, if the intr is combinationally derived from the current mtime and mtimecmp (which are the values before the posedge), then the assertion should check that at the posedge, the intr reflects the comparison of the current (old) mtime and mtimecmp. But in reality, the mtime is updated at the posedge, so the new mtime is available after the posedge. Therefore, the comparison would be based on the new mtime, and the intr would change after the posedge. Therefore, the assertion should check that in the same cycle, after the posedge, the intr reflects the new comparison. But in SVAs, the properties are checked based on the sampled values at the Preponed region, which is before the clock edge. Therefore, the correct approach is to check that the intr signal at the current clock edge (after the posedge) reflects the comparison of the new mtime and mtimecmp. But how to model this?

Alternatively, perhaps the intr is combinationally derived from the current mtime and mtimecmp, which are the values before the posedge. Wait, no. Because mtime is a register that updates on the posedge. So before the posedge, mtime is the old value. After the posedge, it's the new value. If the intr is combinationally derived from mtime, then after the posedge, the intr would reflect the new mtime. But the SVA samples at the posedge (Preponed region), so the assertion would see the old mtime. Therefore, the correct approach is to check that in the next cycle, the intr reflects the comparison of the new mtime (from the previous cycle's update). But that's not correct because the intr should update immediately when mtime changes.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's consider an example:

Cycle 1:
- mtime = 100
- mtimecmp = 150
- intr = 0 (since 100 < 150)

At posedge of Cycle 2:
- mtime is updated to 200 (due to a tick and step)
- Now, mtime (200) >= mtimecmp (150), so intr should be 1.

In the SVA, at the posedge of Cycle 2, the sampled values in the Preponed region are mtime=100, mtimecmp=150. Therefore, the comparison is 100 >= 150 (false), so the assertion would check that intr is 0. But in reality, after the posedge, mtime is 200, and intr should be 1. So the assertion would fail because it's checking the old values.

Therefore, the correct way to model this is to check that the intr signal in the same cycle (after the posedge) reflects the new mtime value. But since SVAs sample signals in the Preponed region, which is before the clock edge, the new mtime value isn't visible yet. Therefore, the assertion needs to check that in the next cycle, the intr reflects the comparison of the current mtime (which was updated in the previous cycle).

Wait, but that would introduce a one-cycle delay between the mtime update and the intr assertion. However, according to the spec, the intr is generated when mtime >= mtimecmp. If the mtime is updated at the posedge, then the comparison should be done immediately, and the intr should assert in the same cycle. But in reality, since the mtime is a register, the new value is only available after the posedge. Therefore, the comparison and intr assertion would happen in the same cycle as the mtime update.

But how to model this in SVA? The key is that the intr is combinationally dependent on the current mtime and mtimecmp. However, since mtime is a register, its value changes at the clock edge. Therefore, the comparison is based on the new value of mtime, which is available after the clock edge. Therefore, the intr signal would change in the same clock cycle, but after the posedge. Therefore, the SVA should check that at the posedge, the intr reflects the comparison of the new mtime and mtimecmp. But since the SVA samples at the Preponed region (before the edge), the new mtime isn't visible yet. Therefore, the correct approach is to check that in the next cycle, the intr reflects the comparison of the mtime that was updated in the current cycle.

This seems like a one-cycle delay, but that's not correct according to the spec. The spec says the interrupt is generated when mtime >= mtimecmp, which should happen as soon as the condition is met. Therefore, the comparison must be combinational, and the intr should assert in the same cycle that the mtime is updated.

This suggests that the mtime is compared combinationally, and the intr is updated immediately when mtime changes. However, since mtime is a register, it only changes at the clock edge. Therefore, the comparison would see the new mtime value after the clock edge, and the intr would assert in the same cycle, but after the edge. Therefore, the SVA needs to check that in the same cycle, after the edge, the intr is correct. But SVAs can't sample signals after the edge; they only see the values from the Preponed region.

This is a common issue with assertions on combinational signals. The solution is to use a concurrent assertion that checks the intr signal combinationally. However, in SystemVerilog, concurrent assertions are clocked, so they sample signals at the clock edge. Therefore, to check combinational behavior, perhaps use an immediate assertion, but that's not suitable for formal verification. Alternatively, model the intr as a combinational signal that changes whenever mtime or mtimecmp changes, but that's not possible in SVAs.

Alternatively, assume that the intr is a registered output. If the intr is registered, then it would update on the next clock edge after the comparison changes. But the spec says it's directly driven by the comparison, implying combinational.

Given this confusion, perhaps the best approach is to write the assertion as follows:

Whenever the mtime is greater than or equal to mtimecmp, the intr should be high, and when it's less, intr should be low. This should be checked at every clock edge, considering the current values of mtime and mtimecmp. However, since mtime is a register that updates on the clock edge, the comparison is based on the new value. Therefore, the assertion should check that at the clock edge, after the update, the intr reflects the new comparison. But since the SVA samples the old values, this approach won't work. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is to check that in the next cycle, the intr reflects the comparison of the current mtime (which was updated in the previous cycle). But this introduces a one-cycle delay, which may not be intended.

Alternatively, maybe the mtime comparison is done combinationally based on the current mtime (before the clock edge), and the intr is combinationally driven. In that case, the assertion should check that at the posedge, the intr reflects the comparison of the current (old) mtime and mtimecmp. Then, when the mtime updates, the next cycle's intr will reflect the new comparison. But this would mean that the intr is based on the previous mtime value. This seems incorrect.

This is a bit of a dilemma. To resolve this, perhaps look back at the spec. The spec says that the interrupt is generated when mtime >= mtimecmp. The mtime is incremented by step when a tick occurs. The tick is generated based on the prescaler. The tick would cause mtime to increment on the next clock edge. Therefore, when the tick occurs, mtime is updated, and the comparison is done with the new mtime value. Therefore, the intr should assert in the same cycle as the mtime update. Therefore, the assertion should check that after the mtime is updated (at the posedge), the intr reflects the new comparison.

But in SVA, since the mtime is sampled at the Preponed region (old value), how to check the new value? It's not possible directly. Therefore, the correct approach is to check that in the next clock cycle, the intr reflects the comparison of the mtime value from the previous cycle plus any step added due to a tick. Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe the key is to model the intr as a combinational signal that is directly driven by mtime and mtimecmp, and the SVA checks that whenever mtime or mtimecmp changes, the intr updates accordingly. But in practice, since mtime is a register, it only changes at the clock edge. Therefore, the assertion can check that at every clock edge, the intr is equal to the comparison of mtime and mtimecmp. However, since mtime is updated at the clock edge, the comparison is based on the new value. But the SVA samples the old value. Therefore, this approach would not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the intr is combinationally derived from mtime_d (the next value of mtime) and mtimecmp. In that case, the assertion would check that intr is equal to (mtime_d >= mtimecmp). But according to the spec, the intr is driven by the comparison between mtime and mtimecmp, not mtime_d. So this may not be correct.

Given the time constraints, perhaps proceed with the following assumptions:

- The intr is combinationally derived from mtime and mtimecmp.
- The mtime is a register that updates on the posedge of clk_i.
- Therefore, after the posedge, the new mtime value is available, and the intr reflects the new comparison.
- The SVA checks that at the posedge, the intr is equal to the comparison of the new mtime and mtimecmp.

But since the SVA samples at the Preponed region (old values), this is not possible. Therefore, the correct approach is to check that in the next cycle, the intr reflects the comparison of the current mtime (which was updated in the previous cycle). This would introduce a one-cycle delay in the assertion, but according to the spec, there should be no delay. Therefore, this suggests that the SVA cannot directly check the combinational behavior and must rely on the design's synchronous properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the comparison is done in the same cycle as the mtime update. For example, when a tick occurs, the mtime is incremented by step in the same cycle, and the comparison is done combinationally, leading to the intr being asserted in the same cycle. In this case, the assertion would check that at the posedge, if the tick is active, then the mtime_d is mtime + step, and the intr should reflect mtime_d >= mtimecmp. But this is getting into the design's implementation details, which may not be provided.

Given the information available, the best approach is to write assertions that check:

1. Width: Each element of intr is 1-bit.
2. Reset: When reset is active, intr is 0.
3. Functionality: When not in reset, intr[i] is high iff mtime >= mtimecmp[i].

Additionally, check that the interrupt deasserts when mtime < mtimecmp.

So the SVAs would be:

- Width: Generate loop for each hart, check $bits(intr[i]) == 1.
- Reset: If rst_ni is low, then intr == 0.
- Functionality: For each hart, if rst_ni is high, then intr[i] == (mtime >= mtimecmp[i]).

But how to handle multiple harts? Since the current version has one hart, but the design is configurable, the assertions should use a generate loop with a localparam for N_HARTS.

Also, the user mentioned that parameters are already added, so we can use N_HARTS as a parameter.

Putting it all together:

Width assertion:

generate for (genvar i = 0; i < N_HARTS; i++) begin : gen_intr_width_check
  assert property (@(posedge clk_i) 1'b1 |-> $bits(intr[i]) == 1);
end endgenerate

Reset assertion:

assert property (@(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> !intr);

Wait, but intr is an array. So for all harts, if reset is active, each intr[i] should be 0.

assert property (@(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> &(!intr));

Or, using a generate loop:

generate for (genvar i = 0; i < N_HARTS; i++) begin : gen_intr_reset_check
  assert property (@(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> !intr[i]);
end endgenerate

Functionality assertion:

generate for (genvar i = 0; i < N_HARTS; i++) begin : gen_intr_function_check
  assert property (@(posedge clk_i) rst_ni |-> intr[i] == (mtime >= mtimecmp[i]));
end endgenerate

But wait, mtimecmp is an array per hart. So mtimecmp[i] is the comparator value for hart i. And mtime is per hart? Wait, according to the spec, each hart has its own mtime register. Wait, the spec says: "Each hart has a set of tick generator and counter. It means the timer IP has the same number of prescalers, steps, and mtime registers as the number of harts."

Ah, so each hart has its own mtime. But in the signal definitions provided, 'mtime' is listed as a 64-bit input. Wait, the user provided:

[Signal name]: intr  
[Related Signals]:  
    - mtime  
    - mtimecmp  

But according to the architecture, each hart has its own mtime. However, in the signal definitions given, 'mtime' is a 64-bit input. This is conflicting. Wait, looking back:

In the user's signal definitions:

Inputs:
- mtime: Input current mtime value

Outputs:
- mtime_d: Output next value of mtime register

But according to the theory of operation, each hart has its own mtime. So there's a discrepancy here. The user may have made a mistake, but according to the provided signal definitions, mtime is a single 64-bit input. Therefore, perhaps in the current version with one hart, mtime is a single 64-bit register. Therefore, the comparison for intr[i] (for hart i) is between the single mtime and mtimecmp[i]. But that doesn't make sense unless each hart has its own mtime. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, the user's signal definitions for the TimerModule include:

Inputs:
- mtime: 64-bit current time value

But according to the theory of operation, each hart has its own mtime. So there's a contradiction. This suggests that the provided signal definitions may be incorrect, but the user expects us to work with what's given.

Given the signal definitions provided, 'mtime' is a single 64-bit input, and 'mtimecmp' is an array of 64-bit values, one per hart. 'intr' is an array of N bits, one per hart. Therefore, each hart's interrupt is generated by comparing the shared mtime with its own mtimecmp[i]. This seems odd, but according to the provided info, that's the case.

Therefore, the functionality assertion for each hart i is: intr[i] == (mtime >= mtimecmp[i]).

So the SVA would be:

For each hart i, when not in reset, intr[i] is high iff mtime >= mtimecmp[i].

Putting it all together:

The generated SVAs would include:

1. Width checks for each intr[i] being 1-bit.
2. Reset checks ensuring all intr[i] are 0 when reset is active.
3. Functionality checks that each intr[i] reflects the comparison between mtime and mtimecmp[i] when not in reset.

Additionally, connectivity checks would ensure that intr is driven by the comparison, which is covered by the functionality assertions.

Another consideration: When the module is inactive (active signal is low), what happens to intr? The spec says 'active' is a module active signal. So if active is low, the module is inactive, and perhaps intr should be 0. But the user's description doesn't mention this. The [Additional information] says the current version has one hart and one timer, but nothing about the 'active' signal affecting intr. Therefore, unless specified, the 'active' signal may not be part of the intr's functionality. The user's description of 'active' is: "Input signal to activate the module". So if active is low, the module is inactive, and perhaps the timer doesn't increment, but the spec doesn't mention that intr is gated by 'active'. Therefore, the SVA may not include 'active' in the assertions unless specified.

In the provided signal definitions, 'active' is an input, but the functionality description of 'intr' doesn't mention it. So the current SVAs don't need to consider 'active' unless specified. The user's description says: "active: Input signal to activate the module". So if the module is inactive, perhaps the intr should be 0. But this is not specified in the functionality. The user's [Functionality] section for 'intr' doesn't mention 'active', so perhaps 'active' doesn't affect 'intr' directly. Therefore, the SVAs may not include 'active' in the assertions.

Another point: The 'intr' could be connected to an interrupt controller. The connectivity assertion would check that the signal is correctly exercised, but without knowing the exact connections, it's hard to write such assertions. Therefore, the connectivity is covered by the functionality and reset checks.

Final SVAs:

- Width: Each intr[i] is 1-bit.
- Reset: When reset is active, all intr[i] are 0.
- Functionality: When reset is inactive, each intr[i] is (mtime >= mtimecmp[i]).

Additionally, check that when mtime < mtimecmp[i], intr[i] is 0.

But the functionality assertion covers both cases. For example:

assert property (@(posedge clk_i) (rst_ni) |-> (intr[i] == (mtime >= mtimecmp[i])) );

This covers both when mtime >= mtimecmp[i] (intr[i] is 1) and when it's not (intr[i] is 0).

So the final answer would include these assertions.
</think>

[Reasoning Process]
1. **Width Check**: Each element in the `intr` array must be 1-bit wide as per the specification. Use a generate loop to verify each hart's interrupt signal width.
2. **Reset Condition**: When reset (`rst_ni`) is active (low), all interrupts must be deasserted.
3. **Functionality**: When not in reset, each interrupt `intr[i]` must assert iff `mtime >= mtimecmp[i]`. This directly follows the specification's interrupt generation rule.
4. **No New Signals**: Only use provided signals (`intr`, `mtime`, `mtimecmp`, `rst_ni`, `clk_i`).

[Verification]
- **Width**: Check each `intr[i]` is 1-bit.
- **Reset**: Ensure `intr` is 0 during reset.
- **Function**: Validate interrupt assertion/deassertion matches `mtime` vs `mtimecmp` comparison.
