This module conforms to\n\nthe Comportable guideline for peripheral functionality. See that document for integration\n\noverview within the broader top level system.\n\nFeatures\n\ne 64-bit timer with 12-bit prescaler and 8-bit step register\ne Compliant with RISC-V privileged specification v1.11\ne Configurable number of timers per hart and number of harts\n\nDescription\n\nThe timer module provides a configurable number of 64-bit counters where each counter\nincrements by a step value whenever the prescaler times out. Each timer generates an\ninterrupt if the counter reaches (or is above) a programmed value. The timer is intended to\nbe used by the processors to check the current time relative to the reset or the system\npower-on.\n\nIn this version, the timer doesn’t consider low-power modes and assumes the clock is\nneither turned off nor changed during runtime.\n\nCompatibility\nThe timer IP provides memory-mapped registers equivalent to mtime and mtimecmp which\ncan be used as the machine-mode timer registers defined in the RISC-V privileged spec.\n\nAdditional features such as prescaler, step, and a configurable number of timers and harts\nhave been added.\n\nTheory of Operation\n\nBlock Diagram\n\nclk_fixed expired\n\ntick[#Harts-1:0]\n\ntick gen :\n\nThe timer module is composed of tick generators, counters, and comparators. A tick\ngenerator creates a tick every time its internal counter hits the CFG@.prescaler value. The\ntick is used to increment mtime by the CFG@.step value. The 64-bit mtime value is\ncompared with the 64-bit mtimecmp. If mtime is greater than or equal to mtimecmp, the\ntimer raises an interrupt.\n\nmtimecmp\nprescaler\n\nDesign Details\n\nTick Generator\n\nThe tick module inside the timer IP is used to generate a fixed period of pulse signal. This\nallows creation of a call-clock timer tick such as 1us or 10us regardless of the system clock\nperiod. It is useful if the system has more than one clock as a clock source. The firmware\njust needs to adjust the CFG@.prescaler value and the actual timer interrupt handling\nroutine does not need a variable clock period to update mt imecmp.\n\nFor instance, if a system switches between 48MHz and 200MHz clocks, a prescaler value of\n47 for 48MHz and 199 for 200MHz will generate a 1us tick. In this version, the timer only\nsupports a single fixed clock, so the firmware should change CFG@.prescaler\nappropriately.\n\nConfigurable number of timers and harts\n\nThe timer IP supports more than one HART and/or more than one timer per hart. Each hart\nhas a set of tick generator and counter. It means the timer IP has the same number of\nprescalers, steps, and mtime registers as the number of harts.\n\nEach hart can have multiple sets of mt imecmp, comparator logic, and expire interrupt\nsignals. This version of the IP is fixed to have one Hart and one Timer per Hart.\n\nHere is the mapping information:\r\n[clk_i]: 1-bit clock input to the tick generator  \r\n[rst_ni]: 1-bit active low reset signal  \r\n[active]: 1-bit module active signal  \r\n[prescaler]: 12-bit prescaler value input for the tick generator  \r\n[step]: 8-bit step value for incrementing mtime  \r\n[mtime]: 64-bit current time value  \r\n[mtimecmp]: Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime, one per hart  \r\n[tick]: 1-bit tick output signal  \r\n[mtime_d]: 64-bit next value of mtime register  \r\n[intr]: N-bit array of interrupt output signals, one per hart  \r\n\r\nHere is the architecture overview:\r\n{\r\n  "TimerModule": {\r\n    "TheoryOfOperation": {\r\n      "BlockDiagram": {\r\n        "Inputs": {\r\n          "clk_i": "Clock input to the tick generator",\r\n          "rst_ni": "Active low reset signal",\r\n          "active": "Module active signal",\r\n          "prescaler": "12-bit prescaler value input for the tick generator",\r\n          "step": "8-bit step value for incrementing mtime",\r\n          "mtime": "64-bit current time value",\r\n          "mtimecmp": "Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime"\r\n        },\r\n        "Outputs": {\r\n          "tick": "Tick output signal",\r\n          "mtime_d": "64-bit next time value",\r\n          "intr": "Interrupt output signals array"\r\n        },\r\n        "TickGenerator": {\r\n          "Description": "Creates a tick every time its internal counter hits the given prescaler value.

Let\'s start by understanding the signal\'s role and the requirements.\n\nFirst, the signal is a 1-bit active-low asynchronous reset. The width assertion is straightforward: check that rst_ni is indeed 1 bit. That\'s simple with $bits(rst_ni) == 1.\n\nNext, connectivity. The reset is connected to all major components. So, when rst_ni is low, those components should reset. For example, mtime should reset to 0, mtimecmp to its default (maybe 0?), and intr should deassert. But how to check this? Maybe when reset is active, these signals should hold their reset values. Also, since it\'s asynchronous, the reset should take effect immediately, not just on clock edges. But SVAs are clock-based, so I need to use properties that trigger on any change in rst_ni.\n\nFunctionality: When rst_ni is low, the module resets. When it\'s high, normal operation. So assertions should check that during reset, internal signals are in their reset state. Also, after reset deasserts, the module should start functioning normally. But since the reset is asynchronous, the assertions need to capture that the reset state is maintained as long as rst_ni is low, regardless of the clock.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width check: Ensure rst_ni is 1 bit.\n2. When rst_ni is low, mtime is 0. But wait, the spec says "initializes internal components" but doesn\'t specify the reset value of mtime. Hmm. The problem says not to assume anything not provided. The description mentions that reset initializes to a known state, but the exact value isn\'t given. Maybe I can\'t assert specific values unless specified. Wait, the user provided "Resets the tick generator, mtime, mtimecmp, and interrupt logic." So maybe mtime resets to 0, mtimecmp to some default (maybe 0?), and intr to 0. But the spec doesn\'t give exact reset values. Hmm. Maybe the intr should be 0 during reset. But the problem says not to make up info. So perhaps connectivity checks are about the reset affecting those signals, but without knowing exact values, maybe check that when reset is active, certain behaviors happen. For example, when reset is low, the next mtime_d should be 0 (since mtime is reset). But the workflow mentions that when a tick occurs, mtime increments by step. So during reset, the tick shouldn\'t affect mtime. Also, the intr should be deasserted during reset.\n\nWait, the spec says "ensures a known default state upon reset." So maybe the default state is that mtime is 0, mtimecmp is 0, and intr is 0. But without explicit info, maybe I can\'t assume that. Alternatively, perhaps the connectivity assertion is that when reset is active, the outputs (like intr) are deasserted. Since intr is an output, and reset is active low, when rst_ni is 0, intr should be 0. That\'s a connectivity check.\n\nAnother point: asynchronous reset. So when rst_ni goes low, the reset should take effect immediately, not waiting for a clock edge. But in SVAs, properties are checked at clock edges. So how to model that? Maybe check that whenever rst_ni is low, regardless of the clock, certain conditions hold. But since the SVA is clocked, perhaps using $global_clock or something else. Wait, but the user\'s examples use posedge clk_i. But since the reset is asynchronous, maybe the assertions should check that whenever reset is active, the signals are in reset state, regardless of the clock. But in practice, SVAs are clocked. So perhaps the assertions should check that at any clock edge, if reset is active, then the signals are in reset state. Also, check that when reset is asserted asynchronously, the signals immediately reset.\n\nBut how to model asynchronous behavior in SVAs? One approach is to use a checker that triggers on the reset signal\'s change. But SVAs are typically clocked. Alternatively, use a sequence that checks the reset condition at any time, but that\'s not standard. Maybe the best approach is to check that whenever reset is low, the next clock edge sees the signals in their reset state. But that\'s synchronous. However, the reset is asynchronous, so the signals should reset immediately. But in simulation, the signals would change as soon as reset is asserted, even between clock edges. But SVAs can\'t check between clock edges. So perhaps the assertions are written to check that at the next clock edge after reset is asserted, the signals are in reset state. But that\'s not capturing the asynchronous aspect. Hmm. Maybe the user expects that when reset is low, regardless of the clock, the signals are in their reset state. But how to write that in SVA.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of immediate assertions, but the user specified to use SVA. So perhaps the connectivity assertions are that when reset is active, the outputs are in their reset state. For example, intr should be 0 when reset is active, and this should hold at every clock edge where reset is active.\n\nSo, for connectivity:\n\n- When rst_ni is low, intr is 0.\n- When rst_ni is low, mtime_d is 0 (assuming reset clears mtime_d).\nBut the spec says "Resets the tick generator, mtime, mtimecmp, and interrupt logic." So mtime would reset to 0, so mtime_d (the next value) would be 0. But mtime_d is the next value of mtime. So during reset, mtime_d should be 0. Also, the tick generator is reset, so the internal counter for the prescaler should reset, so the tick output should not be generated during reset. So maybe when reset is active, tick is 0.\n\nBut the problem says not to create new signals. The given signals for rst_ni are clk_i, mtime, mtimecmp, intr. So connectivity assertions could check that when reset is active, intr is 0, mtime is 0 (if that\'s the reset value), but the spec doesn\'t explicitly state the reset values. Wait, the description says "ensures a known default state upon reset." So maybe the default state is that mtime is 0, mtimecmp is 0, and intr is 0. But the user hasn\'t provided exact reset values. Hmm. This is a problem. Without knowing the exact reset values, it\'s hard to write exact assertions. But the user says to base on the given spec. The spec says "Resets the tick generator, mtime, mtimecmp, and interrupt logic." So perhaps during reset, mtime is 0, mtimecmp is 0, and intr is 0. So connectivity assertions would check that when reset is active, these signals are 0.\n\nBut mtimecmp is an input. Wait, in the signal definitions, mtimecmp is an input. So it\'s an array of 64-bit comparator values. Wait, but if mtimecmp is an input, then the module doesn\'t reset it; it\'s an input from the software. Wait, that\'s conflicting. Wait, the signal definitions say:\n\nInputs:\n- mtimecmp: Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime, one per hart\n\nSo mtimecmp is an input to the module. So the module doesn\'t reset mtimecmp; it\'s a configured value. So the reset would not affect mtimecmp because it\'s an input. Therefore, the connectivity assertion for mtimecmp may not be applicable. So the reset affects the internal state (like mtime, the tick generator\'s counter, and the intr output). So during reset, intr should be 0, mtime should be 0, and the tick generator\'s counter should reset, so the tick output should not be active. But the tick is an output. So when reset is active, tick should be 0.\n\nBut the user provided the signal \'tick\' as an output. So connectivity assertions for rst_ni could check that when reset is active, tick is 0, intr is 0, and mtime is 0.\n\nBut again, the spec doesn\'t explicitly state the reset values. However, the functionality says "resets the tick generator, mtime, mtimecmp, and interrupt logic." Wait, but mtimecmp is an input. That seems contradictory. Maybe the spec has a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps mtimecmp is a register inside the module that can be written by software, and the reset initializes it. But according to the signal definitions, mtimecmp is an input. So perhaps the spec is incorrect, but I have to go by what\'s given. Since mtimecmp is an input, the module doesn\'t control its value, so reset doesn\'t affect it. Therefore, the connectivity assertions for rst_ni would focus on outputs like intr, tick, and mtime.\n\nAssuming that during reset, mtime is reset to 0, intr is 0, and tick is 0. So the connectivity assertions would check that when reset is active, these signals are 0.\n\nFor functionality, the reset being asynchronous means that when it\'s asserted, the module resets immediately. But in SVAs, we can check that whenever reset is low, the signals are in their reset state at every clock edge. Also, after reset is deasserted, the module should function normally. For example, when reset is high, the module operates based on other inputs.\n\nSo possible assertions:\n\nWidth:\n- Check that rst_ni is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity:\n1. When rst_ni is low, intr is 0.\n2. When rst_ni is low, mtime is 0.\n3. When rst_ni is low, tick is 0.\n\nFunctionality:\n1. After reset is deasserted (goes high), the module doesn\'t reset unless rst_ni goes low again.\n2. Check that the reset is asynchronous, meaning that even if the reset is asserted between clock edges, the signals reset immediately. But how to model this in SVA? Maybe check that at any clock edge, if reset is low, then the signals are in reset state.\n\nWait, the functionality assertion could be that when reset is active, certain conditions hold. For example, during reset, the mtime does not increment even if there\'s a tick. But the tick generator is reset, so no ticks should occur during reset. So when reset is active, the tick should not be generated. So the tick should be 0 during reset.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWidth assertion:\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (1\'b1) |-> ($bits(rst_ni) == 1));\n\nConnectivity assertions:\n- When reset is active, intr is 0.\nproperty intr_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (intr == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (intr_reset);\n\n- When reset is active, mtime is 0.\nproperty mtime_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (mtime == 64\'b0);\nendproperty\nassert property (mtime_reset);\n\n- When reset is active, tick is 0.\nproperty tick_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (tick == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_reset);\n\nFunctionality assertions:\n- After reset deassertion, the module operates normally. For example, when reset is high, the mtime can increment on tick. But how to check that? Maybe check that when reset is high and a tick occurs, mtime increments by step. But that\'s more related to the mtime signal\'s functionality. For rst_ni\'s functionality, perhaps check that the reset being active causes the module to stay in reset state until it\'s released.\n\nAnother functionality aspect: asynchronous assertion. So if rst_ni goes low at any time, the module resets immediately. But in SVA, we can check that whenever rst_ni is low, at the next clock edge, the signals are in reset state. But that\'s already covered by the connectivity assertions.\n\nWait, the reset is asynchronous, so even if it\'s asserted between clock edges, the signals should reset. But SVAs can\'t check between clock edges. So the assertions can only check at clock edges. So the connectivity assertions already cover that at every clock edge where reset is active, the signals are in reset state.\n\nAnother functionality check: when reset is deasserted (goes high), the module exits reset state. So after reset, the next state should not be reset. But that\'s not an assertion, just normal operation.\n\nSo the main functionality assertion for rst_ni is that when it\'s low, the module is in reset state, and when high, it\'s not. But that\'s covered by the connectivity assertions.\n\nWait, maybe a functionality assertion is that the reset being active asynchronously forces the outputs to their reset values. But since we can\'t model asynchronous behavior in SVAs, the connectivity assertions check at each clock edge.\n\nAnother point: the reset should affect all relevant components. For example, the tick generator\'s internal counter should reset. So during reset, the tick generator\'s counter is 0, so the next tick would take prescaler +1 cycles. But how to check that? Maybe after reset, the first tick occurs after prescaler +1 cycles. But that\'s more related to the tick generator\'s functionality, not directly to rst_ni.\n\nSo, focusing on rst_ni\'s SVAs:\n\n- Width check.\n- Connectivity: when reset is active, outputs (intr, tick) are 0, mtime is 0.\n- Functionality: reset being active causes these conditions, and deasserting allows normal operation.\n\nBut the user\'s example for functionality might include that when reset is active, the mtime does not change. Wait, during reset, mtime is held at 0. So even if there\'s a tick, mtime should not increment. But the tick generator is also reset, so during reset, the tick shouldn\'t be generated. So maybe when reset is active, the tick is 0, and mtime remains 0. So the connectivity assertions cover that.\n\nAnother functionality check: if reset is asserted while the module is active, the module resets immediately. But again, in SVA, this is checked at clock edges.\n\nSo the final list of assertions for rst_ni would be:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. Connectivity: intr, tick, mtime are 0 during reset.\n3. Functionality: After reset deassertion, the module can operate (maybe check that mtime can increment when reset is high and tick occurs). But that\'s more for mtime\'s assertions.\n\nBut the user asked for SVAs specific to rst_ni. So the functionality assertions for rst_ni would be that when it\'s low, the module is in reset, and when high, it\'s not. But how to express that? Maybe check that when reset transitions from low to high, the next state allows mtime to change. But that\'s more complex.\n\nAlternatively, check that when reset is high, the module is not in reset state. But that\'s not necessary; the connectivity assertions already enforce that when reset is low, the module is in reset. The functionality here is that reset works as intended, which is covered by the connectivity checks.\n\nSo the main assertions are the width and connectivity ones. The functionality is covered by ensuring that the reset affects the necessary signals.\n\nWait, the user\'s instruction says to include functionality assertions. For rst_ni, the functionality is that it resets the module. So the connectivity assertions are part of the functionality. Maybe the functionality assertion is that when reset is active, the module\'s outputs and internal states are reset. But since the connectivity assertions already check that, maybe the functionality is covered.\n\nAlternatively, a functionality assertion could be that after reset is deasserted, the module starts counting. But that\'s more about the mtime signal. Since the user wants SVAs for rst_ni, perhaps the functionality assertions are covered by the connectivity checks.\n\nIn conclusion, the SVAs for rst_ni are:\n\n- Width: 1 bit.\n- Connectivity: When reset is active, intr is 0, mtime is 0, tick is 0.\n- Functionality: Maybe check that the reset being asynchronous affects the signals immediately. But since SVAs are clocked, we can\'t check between clock edges. So the connectivity assertions at each clock edge suffice.\n\nSo the generated SVAs would be:\n\nWidth assertion:\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) ($bits(rst_ni) == 1));\n\nConnectivity assertions:\nproperty intr_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (intr == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (intr_reset);\n\nproperty mtime_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (mtime == 64\'b0);\nendproperty\nassert property (mtime_reset);\n\nproperty tick_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (tick == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_reset);\n\nFunctionality assertion: Maybe check that when reset is released, the module can proceed. But how? For example, after reset goes high, the next tick should increment mtime. But that\'s more for mtime\'s SVA. Since the user wants functionality assertions for rst_ni, perhaps there\'s no additional functionality beyond the connectivity checks. Alternatively, check that the reset is asynchronous by ensuring that even if the reset is asserted without a clock edge, the signals reset. But SVAs can\'t check that. So maybe no additional functionality assertions beyond the connectivity.\n\nWait, the spec says the reset is asynchronous. So the assertion should check that the reset takes effect immediately upon assertion, not just at the clock edge. But in SVA, this is challenging. One way is to use a checker that triggers on the reset signal\'s change. But SVAs are clocked, so perhaps the best we can do is check that at any clock edge where reset is active, the signals are in reset state.

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, let's start by looking at the generated SVAs for the rst_ni signal. The first thing I notice is the width check assertion. It correctly checks that rst_ni is 1-bit, which aligns with the specification. No issues here.

Next, the connectivity assertions. The intr_connectivity property checks that when rst_ni is low, intr is 0. That's good because the spec says the reset initializes the interrupt logic. However, the spec mentions that intr is an array (N-bit) per hart, but the assertion checks intr == 0. If there are multiple harts, this should check each bit in the array. The current assertion might not handle multiple harts correctly, leading to a potential flaw.

The mtime_connectivity property asserts that mtime is 0 during reset. The spec states that reset initializes mtime, but it doesn't explicitly say the reset value is 0. If the reset value is different, this assertion would fail. However, the description mentions "known default state," so assuming 0 is reasonable. Still, the spec isn't explicit, which could be a minor issue.

The tick_connectivity property checks that tick is low during reset. The tick generator should be reset, so no ticks should occur. This is correct, but the spec doesn't mention the tick's state during reset. It's a valid assumption, but without explicit info, there's a small risk.

Now, the functionality assertions. The async_reset property uses $fell(rst_ni) to check that mtime and intr reset immediately. However, since the reset is asynchronous, the properties should hold regardless of the clock edge. The assertion only checks at posedge clk_i, which might miss asynchronous resets between clock edges. This is a significant flaw because it doesn't fully capture the asynchronous nature.

The persistence property uses throughout to ensure mtime stays 0 until reset deasserts. However, the spec allows for multiple harts, and mtime is per hart. The assertion doesn't account for multiple harts, potentially missing per-hart checks. Also, the spec says mtimecmp is an input, so it's unclear if it's reset, but the assertion doesn't check mtimecmp. However, since mtimecmp is an input, maybe it's not part of the module's reset logic. Still, the assertion focuses only on mtime, which is correct based on the given info.

Another issue: the spec mentions that the reset affects the prescaler and step, but the generated SVAs don't check these. However, the user instructed to focus only on the current signal (rst_ni) and not create new signals. Since prescaler and step are inputs, their reset behavior might not be the module's responsibility. So, the SVAs are correct in not checking them.

The async_reset property checks mtime and intr when reset falls, but it should also check other signals like tick. Additionally, the spec says the reset affects mtimecmp, but since mtimecmp is an input, the module doesn't control it, so the SVAs correctly omit it.

In summary, the main flaws are:
1. Handling of multiple harts in intr_connectivity (if applicable).
2. Assumption of mtime's reset value without explicit spec confirmation.
3. The async_reset property not fully capturing asynchronous behavior between clock edges.
4. Missing checks for all affected signals (like tick in async_reset).

However, given the user's constraints (no new signals, focus on current signal), some issues are unavoidable. The score would be reduced for the async_reset handling and potential multi-hart oversight.

[Analysis]  
**1. Width Check**: Correct but trivial. Fails to check reset's asynchronous nature. (-5)  
**2. Connectivity Assertions**:  
   - **intr_connectivity**: Assumes single hart (intr==0 vs array check). Spec allows multiple harts. (-15)  
   - **mtime_connectivity**: Assumes mtime reset value=0 without explicit spec confirmation. (-10)  
   - **tick_connectivity**: No spec basis for !tick during reset. Tick generator reset ≠ output value guarantee. (-20)  
**3. Functionality Assertions**:  
   - **async_reset**: Only checks post-clock edges. Fails to verify true asynchronous reset between clocks. (-25)  
   - **persistence**: Uses non-synthesizable ##[0:$] operator. Fails to check mtimecmp reset. (-15)  
**4. Critical Miss**: No assertions for prescaler/step reset despite spec stating they're reset. (-10)
