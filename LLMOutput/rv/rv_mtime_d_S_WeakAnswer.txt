This module conforms to\n\nthe Comportable guideline for peripheral functionality. See that document for integration\n\noverview within the broader top level system.\n\nFeatures\n\ne 64-bit timer with 12-bit prescaler and 8-bit step register\ne Compliant with RISC-V privileged specification v1.11\ne Configurable number of timers per hart and number of harts\n\nDescription\n\nThe timer module provides a configurable number of 64-bit counters where each counter\nincrements by a step value whenever the prescaler times out. Each timer generates an\ninterrupt if the counter reaches (or is above) a programmed value. The timer is intended to\nbe used by the processors to check the current time relative to the reset or the system\npower-on.\n\nIn this version, the timer doesnâ€™t consider low-power modes and assumes the clock is\nneither turned off nor changed during runtime.\n\nCompatibility\nThe timer IP provides memory-mapped registers equivalent to mtime and mtimecmp which\ncan be used as the machine-mode timer registers defined in the RISC-V privileged spec.\n\nAdditional features such as prescaler, step, and a configurable number of timers and harts\nhave been added.\n\nTheory of Operation\n\nBlock Diagram\n\nclk_fixed expired\n\ntick[#Harts-1:0]\n\ntick gen :\n\nThe timer module is composed of tick generators, counters, and comparators. A tick\ngenerator creates a tick every time its internal counter hits the CFG@.prescaler value. The\ntick is used to increment mtime by the CFG@.step value. The 64-bit mtime value is\ncompared with the 64-bit mtimecmp. If mtime is greater than or equal to mtimecmp, the\ntimer raises an interrupt.\n\nmtimecmp\nprescaler\n\nDesign Details\n\nTick Generator\n\nThe tick module inside the timer IP is used to generate a fixed period of pulse signal. This\nallows creation of a call-clock timer tick such as 1us or 10us regardless of the system clock\nperiod. It is useful if the system has more than one clock as a clock source. The firmware\njust needs to adjust the CFG@.prescaler value and the actual timer interrupt handling\nroutine does not need a variable clock period to update mt imecmp.\n\nFor instance, if a system switches between 48MHz and 200MHz clocks, a prescaler value of\n47 for 48MHz and 199 for 200MHz will generate a 1us tick. In this version, the timer only\nsupports a single fixed clock, so the firmware should change CFG@.prescaler\nappropriately.\n\nConfigurable number of timers and harts\n\nThe timer IP supports more than one HART and/or more than one timer per hart. Each hart\nhas a set of tick generator and counter. It means the timer IP has the same number of\nprescalers, steps, and mtime registers as the number of harts.\n\nEach hart can have multiple sets of mt imecmp, comparator logic, and expire interrupt\nsignals. This version of the IP is fixed to have one Hart and one Timer per Hart.\n\nHere is the mapping information:\r\n[clk_i]: 1-bit clock input to the tick generator  \r\n[rst_ni]: 1-bit active low reset signal  \r\n[active]: 1-bit module active signal  \r\n[prescaler]: 12-bit prescaler value input for the tick generator  \r\n[step]: 8-bit step value for incrementing mtime  \r\n[mtime]: 64-bit current time value  \r\n[mtimecmp]: Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime, one per hart  \r\n[tick]: 1-bit tick output signal  \r\n[mtime_d]: 64-bit next value of mtime register  \r\n[intr]: N-bit array of interrupt output signals, one per hart  \r\n\r\nHere is the architecture overview:\r\n{\r\n  "TimerModule": {\r\n    "TheoryOfOperation": {\r\n      "BlockDiagram": {\r\n        "Inputs": {\r\n          "clk_i": "Clock input to the tick generator",\r\n          "rst_ni": "Active low reset signal",\r\n          "active": "Module active signal",\r\n          "prescaler": "12-bit prescaler value input for the tick generator",\r\n          "step": "8-bit step value for incrementing mtime",\r\n          "mtime": "64-bit current time value",\r\n          "mtimecmp": "Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime"\r\n        },\r\n        "Outputs": {\r\n          "tick": "Tick output signal",\r\n          "mtime_d": "64-bit next time value",\r\n          "intr": "Interrupt output signals array"\r\n        },\r\n        "TickGenerator": {\r\n          "Description": "Creates a tick every time its internal counter hits the given prescaler value.

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal mtime_d based on the provided specifications. Let me start by understanding the signal's role and connections.

First, the mtime_d is a 64-bit output that represents the next value of the mtime register. Its functionality is to increment the current mtime by the step value when a tick occurs. So, the main thing here is to check that whenever there's a tick, mtime_d is correctly calculated as mtime + step. If there's no tick, mtime_d should remain the same as mtime.

Looking at the width assertion: The spec says mtime_d is 64 bits. So I need an assertion to check that the width is indeed 64 bits using $bits.

For connectivity, mtime_d is derived from mtime, step, and tick. So I should check that when tick is high, mtime_d is the sum of mtime and step. When tick is low, mtime_d should equal mtime. Also, since mtime_d updates the mtime register, there should be a check that on the next clock edge, mtime becomes mtime_d. That's a connectivity check between mtime_d and mtime.

Functionality-wise, the key is the increment on tick. So an assertion that when tick is active, mtime_d is mtime + step. Also, if the prescaler is zero, maybe the tick is generated every cycle, but the spec says the prescaler is 12-bit, so maybe that's handled elsewhere. But for mtime_d, the main thing is the addition when tick is high.

Wait, the prescaler affects when the tick is generated, but for mtime_d, the assertion is only about the relationship when tick is present. So the SVA should trigger when tick is high.

Also, need to consider reset. During reset, mtime_d might be reset, but the spec doesn't mention reset behavior for mtime_d, so maybe the assertions should be gated with !rst_ni (active low reset). But the user didn't specify reset conditions for mtime_d, so perhaps the assertions should assume the reset is handled elsewhere and focus on active operation.

Another point: the step is 8 bits, but mtime is 64 bits. Adding an 8-bit step to a 64-bit mtime would require sign extension or zero extension. But the spec says step is 8-bit, so probably it's treated as an unsigned value, so when added to mtime, it's zero-extended. So the assertion should check that mtime_d is mtime + step when tick is high, regardless of step's size.

Wait, in Verilog, adding an 8-bit step to a 64-bit mtime would automatically zero-extend the step. So the calculation is correct as mtime + step. So the assertion should just check that.

Now, considering the related signals: mtime, step, tick. The SVA should cover all these.

So, the width assertion is straightforward: check that the width of mtime_d is 64 bits.

Connectivity: Check that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. Also, check that when tick is low, mtime_d remains mtime. Additionally, check that mtime updates to mtime_d on the next clock cycle.

Functionality: Ensure that the increment happens correctly when tick is active, and that the mtime register follows mtime_d.

Wait, the mtime_d is the next value of mtime, so the connectivity between them would be that mtime should be updated to mtime_d on the next clock edge. So an assertion like: on the next clock, mtime should be equal to $past(mtime_d). But since mtime_d is the next value, maybe it's better to check that in the same cycle, mtime_d is the value that mtime will take in the next cycle. However, in synchronous logic, the mtime register would capture mtime_d on the next posedge. So an assertion could be: after a posedge, mtime should be equal to the previous mtime_d.

But how to write that? Using $past(mtime_d, 1) would refer to the previous cycle's mtime_d, which should be the current mtime. So the assertion would be: assert property (@(posedge clk_i) mtime == $past(mtime_d)); But this depends on the design's implementation. If mtime is indeed updated from mtime_d on each clock edge, then this holds. The spec says mtime_d is the next value, so this connectivity check is valid.

So, putting it all together:

Width assertion: Check that mtime_d is 64 bits.

Connectivity assertions:
1. When tick is high, mtime_d == mtime + step.
2. When tick is low, mtime_d == mtime.
3. mtime is updated to mtime_d in the next cycle.

Functionality assertions:
Same as connectivity 1 and 2, but also check that the increment leads to the interrupt when mtime_d crosses mtimecmp. Wait, but the interrupt is based on mtime, not mtime_d. Since mtime_d is the next value, maybe that's handled in the mtime assertions. For mtime_d's functionality, the main thing is the correct calculation based on tick and step.

Wait, the functionality of mtime_d is to compute the next mtime value. So the key assertions are the ones that check the addition when tick is present and no change when not. Those are covered in connectivity.

So the SVAs would be:

Width:
assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(mtime_d) == 64);

Connectivity:
1. When tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step.
   assert property (@(posedge clk_i) tick |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step)));
2. When tick is low, mtime_d is mtime.
   assert property (@(posedge clk_i) !tick |-> (mtime_d == mtime));
3. mtime updates to mtime_d in the next cycle.
   assert property (@(posedge clk_i) mtime == $past(mtime_d, 1));

Wait, but the third assertion checks that the current mtime is equal to the previous mtime_d. That would be true if mtime is a register that latches mtime_d on each clock edge. So that's a valid connectivity check between mtime and mtime_d.

Functionality: The first two connectivity assertions also cover the functionality. Additionally, maybe check that the step is correctly applied. For example, if step is 0, then mtime_d should be mtime even if tick is high. But according to the spec, step is the value to add when tick occurs. So regardless of step's value, the addition should happen.

Another point: the spec mentions that the step is 8-bit. So when adding to 64-bit mtime, the step is zero-extended. The SVA should account for that. But in Verilog, adding an 8-bit to 64-bit automatically zero-extends, so the assertion mtime_d == mtime + step is correct.

Also, need to consider the active signal. The module has an active input. If active is low, maybe the timer is disabled. So the assertions should check that when active is low, mtime_d doesn't change. But the description says "active: 1-bit module active signal". So when active is low, perhaps the timer is inactive. However, the provided signal description for mtime_d doesn't mention being affected by active. The spec says "active: Input signal to activate the module". So maybe when active is low, the mtime_d doesn't update. But the user's description for mtime_d's functionality doesn't mention this. The provided info under mtime_d's functionality says it's calculated by adding step when tick is generated. So perhaps the active signal gates the tick? Or affects the mtime_d calculation.

Wait, the block diagram mentions active as an input. The workflow says the module is active when active is high. So if active is low, the timer might not operate. But the mtime_d's definition says it's the next value of mtime. So if the module is inactive, perhaps mtime doesn't update, so mtime_d should remain as mtime. So the connectivity assertions should also consider the active signal.

But the user's description for mtime_d's functionality doesn't mention the active signal. The provided info under mtime_d's Functionality says: "Calculated by adding the step value to the current mtime when a tick is generated." So maybe the active signal is not directly part of mtime_d's calculation, but perhaps the tick is only generated when active is high. However, the user hasn't specified that. Since the active signal is part of the module's inputs, but the mtime_d's description doesn't mention it, perhaps the assertions should not include active unless specified.

But the problem says: "Do not generate any new signals. Do NOT make any new information that is not provided." So if the active signal is part of the module's inputs but not mentioned in mtime_d's functionality, then the assertions for mtime_d should not include active unless the spec says so.

Looking back at the spec's signal definitions for mtime_d: the Interconnection says it's derived from mtime, step, and tick. Active is not listed here. So the active signal may gate the tick generation, but for mtime_d's calculation, it's only based on tick, mtime, and step. Therefore, the existing assertions (based on tick) are sufficient.

So the SVAs are:

1. Width check: 64 bits.
2. When tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step.
3. When tick is low, mtime_d is mtime.
4. mtime is updated to mtime_d in the next cycle.

Additionally, check that the step is 8 bits, but that's part of the step signal's assertions, not mtime_d's. So no need here.

Another possible check: after reset, mtime_d should have a known value, but the spec doesn't mention reset values, so maybe that's not covered here.

So the final SVAs would be the four points above. Now, translating these into SystemVerilog:

Width assertion:
assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(mtime_d) == 64);

For the connectivity when tick is high:
assert property (@(posedge clk_i) tick |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step)));

When tick is low:
assert property (@(posedge clk_i) !tick |-> (mtime_d == mtime));

For the mtime update:
assert property (@(posedge clk_i) mtime == $past(mtime_d, 1));

Wait, but $past(mtime_d, 1) refers to the value of mtime_d in the previous cycle. So in the current cycle, mtime should be equal to the previous mtime_d. That would be true if mtime is a register that is updated with mtime_d on each clock edge. So this assertion checks that mtime is indeed the previous mtime_d, ensuring the connectivity between mtime_d and mtime.

These four assertions cover width, connectivity, and functionality.

But the user asked to include at least the three types: width, connectivity, functionality. The first is width. The second and third are connectivity (direct derivation from mtime, step, tick) and functionality (correct calculation). The fourth is connectivity between mtime_d and mtime.

So all required types are covered.
</think>

[Reasoning Process]
The mtime_d signal is the next value of mtime, updated by adding step when tick occurs. Key checks include width (64 bits), correct derivation from mtime/step/tick, and proper propagation to mtime. Connectivity assertions verify relationships with inputs and mtime, while functionality assertions ensure correct increment logic.

[Verification]
1. **Width**: Confirm mtime_d is 64-bit.
2. **Connectivity**: Check mtime_d is driven by mtime + step (tick=1) or mtime (tick=0), and propagates to mtime.
3. **Functionality**: Validate increment logic and value stability when no tick occurs.
