Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for clk_i. First, I need to understand the specifications and the previous feedback to ensure correctness.

The clk_i is a 1-bit input clock driving the tick generator. The module uses a fixed clock, so clk_i must remain stable. The tick is generated when the internal counter matches the prescaler value, and mtime increments by the step value on each tick.

From the previous attempts, there were issues with tautological assertions and handling dynamic prescaler changes. The connectivity check using $stable(tick) || $changed(tick) was a tautology. Also, the tick periodicity check didn't handle prescaler changes correctly.

First, the width assertion is straightforward: check clk_i is 1-bit.

For connectivity, instead of the tautology, I'll check that tick doesn't change between clock edges by using a negedge check. This ensures tick stability between posedges.

For functionality, mtime should increment by step when tick is high, considering reset and active signals. Using $past ensures we capture the correct values. The tick periodicity must account for dynamic prescaler changes by using $past(prescaler) and resetting the counter after each tick. Also, the single-cycle tick assertion needs to handle prescaler=0 correctly.

Including disable conditions for reset and active is crucial to avoid false failures. Also, ensuring that the step is cast to 64-bit prevents width mismatch.

Finally, adding checks for clock stability and reset behavior ensures comprehensive coverage.

[REASONING]  
1. **Width Check**: Mandatory per spec to verify 1-bit clock signal integrity.  
2. **Clock-Tick Alignment**: Ensure tick changes only at clock edges using dual-edge checking.  
3. **mtime Increment**: Validate timer math with explicit bit-width conversion and reset guards.  
4. **Prescaler Periodicity**: Handle dynamic prescaler changes using sampled values and counter reset logic.  
5. **Single-Cycle Pulse**: Allow prescaler=0 configuration while maintaining pulse integrity.  

[SVAs]  
```systemverilog
// Width check - Fundamental signal integrity
assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(clk_i) == 1);

// Clock domain alignment - Critical for timing validation
property TICK_CLOCK_SYNC;
    @(negedge clk_i) !$changed(tick); // Must remain stable between edges
endproperty
assert property (TICK_CLOCK_SYNC);

// Core timer functionality - With complete reset/active handling
property MTIME_INCREMENT;
    @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
    tick |-> mtime_d == ($past(mtime) + 64'($past(step)));
endproperty
assert property (MTIME_INCREMENT);

// Prescaler-driven tick generation - Full dynamic handling
property TICK_PERIODICITY;
    int count;
    @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
    (1, count=0) |->
    ##1 (1, count=($past(prescaler) == 0) ? 1 : count+1))[*0:$]
    ##1 (count > $past(prescaler)) |-> tick ##1 (count=0);
endproperty
assert property (TICK_PERIODICITY);

// Single-cycle pulse enforcement - Spec-compliant for prescaler=0
property SINGLE_CYCLE_TICK;
    @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (prescaler == 0)
    tick |=> !tick;
endproperty
assert property (SINGLE_CYCLE_TICK);

// Reset state validation - Critical power-on behavior
assert property (@(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> !tick);
```  

This implementation:  
1. Eliminates tautological checks using concrete edge relationships  
2. Handles dynamic prescaler changes with temporal operators  
3. Enforces bit-width safety in arithmetic operations  
4. Provides full reset/active signal coverage  
5. Complies with spec requirements for prescaler=0 edge case
