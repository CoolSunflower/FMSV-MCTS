Okay, so I need to extract all unique and valid assertions related to the signal 'prescaler' from the given list. The user emphasized retaining as many as possible, especially ensuring the width assertion is present. Let me start by going through each assertion one by one.

First, looking at the list provided:

1. The first assertion checks that the bit width of prescaler is 12. That's crucial because the documentation mentions a 12-bit prescaler. So this one definitely stays.

2. The second assertion says that if prescaler is 0 and active, then in the next cycle there's a tick. Hmm, this is about functionality when prescaler is zero. Valid.

3. Third assertion checks that when reset is deasserted (rst_ni is low), tick is low. Not directly about prescaler, but maybe related via the reset condition. Wait, the signal here is prescaler? No, the assertion is about 'tick' when reset is low. Maybe not directly about prescaler, so maybe exclude this. Wait, the user asked for assertions for the signal 'prescaler'. So this might not be relevant. Wait, the user said "for the signal name: prescaler". So only assertions that directly involve prescaler.

Wait, the problem is to extract assertions that involve the 'prescaler' signal. So any assertion that references 'prescaler' in the property.

Looking again:

1. The first one checks $bits(prescaler) == 12. That's about the width, so definitely keep.

2. The second assertion uses prescaler == 0 in the antecedent. So this involves prescaler.

3. Third assertion is about !rst_ni |-> !tick. Doesn't mention prescaler. So exclude.

4. Fourth: no_tick_inactive property has (!active || !rst_ni) |-> !tick. Doesn't involve prescaler. Exclude.

5. tick_pulse_width: checks tick |=> !tick, but doesn't mention prescaler. Exclude.

6. prescaler_stability: $changed(prescaler) |-> tick. This involves prescaler. Keep.

7. zero_prescaler: (prescaler == 0) |-> ##1 tick. Keep.

8. reset_checks: doesn't mention prescaler. Exclude.

9. inactive_no_ticks: again, no prescaler. Exclude.

10. single_cycle_tick: no prescaler. Exclude.

11. prescaler_stable: tick |=> $stable(prescaler) until_with tick. Involves prescaler. Keep.

12. Another prescaler_stability: $changed(prescaler) |-> !tick. Different from the previous one. Keep.

13. first_tick_post_activation: involves prescaler? Let me check. The property is $rose(active) && rst_ni |-> ##1 (!tick [*0:$] ##1 tick). Doesn't directly mention prescaler. So exclude.

14. no_tick_inactive: same as before, no prescaler. Exclude.

15. prescaler_tick_period: (tick, p = prescaler) |-> ##(p +1) tick. This involves prescaler. Keep.

16. Another first_tick_post_activation: this one has ($rose(active) && rst_ni, p = prescaler) |-> ##(p +1) tick. So here prescaler is used. Keep.

17. tick_pulse_width: checks (prescaler == 0) || ##1 !tick. This involves prescaler. Keep.

Now, compiling which assertions are about prescaler:

1. Bit width check: yes.

2. (prescaler ==0 and active) |-> tick next cycle.

6. prescaler_stability: if prescaler changes, then tick occurs.

7. zero_prescaler: if prescaler is 0, next cycle tick.

11. prescaler_stable: after tick, prescaler is stable until next tick.

12. Changed prescaler leads to no tick.

15. When tick occurs, next tick is after p+1 cycles (p is prescaler value).

16. After activation, first tick is after p+1 cycles (p is prescaler).

17. If tick occurs, then either prescaler is 0 or next cycle no tick.

So among these, which are unique and valid?

Also, check for duplicates. Let's see:

The original list has multiple assertions. Some might be duplicates or conflicting.

Looking at assertion 6 and 12. The first has $changed(prescaler) |-> tick, the second $changed(prescaler) |-> !tick. That's conflicting. But need to check if both are present in the input list.

Looking back at the provided list:

The user provided the list of assertions. The 6th one (as per the list) is:

'property prescaler_stability;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)\n  $changed(prescaler) |-> tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (prescaler_stability);'

The 12th in the list is:

'property prescaler_stability;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)\n  $changed(prescaler) |-> !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (prescaler_stability);'

These two have the same property name but different implications. That's a conflict. So probably the user has a typo here, but according to the problem statement, we need to consider all unique ones. However, the user might have copied two different assertions with the same name but different conditions. So both are present but are separate.

But since they are two separate assertions, even if their names are the same, they are different code. So in the input list, these are two distinct entries:

6. prescaler_stability with $changed(prescaler) |-> tick.

12. prescaler_stability (same name) with $changed(prescaler) |-> !tick.

But wait, the code for assertion 6 is:

prescaler_stability

disable iff (...)
$changed(prescaler) |-> tick;

Assertion 12 is:

prescaler_stability

disable iff (...)
$changed(prescaler) |-> !tick;

These are conflicting. However, in the list given by the user, they are separate entries. So both need to be considered as separate even though the property names are the same. But since the user wants all unique and valid assertions, perhaps both are needed, even though the property names clash. But in SystemVerilog, the same property name in the same scope would cause an error, but since the user has provided them as separate entries, maybe they are in different scopes, but perhaps in reality, it's possible that they are different. But for the purpose of the answer, we have to take them as given.

The user instructions say "extract all unique and valid assertions from this list" so regardless of duplicates or conflicts, if they are different code, they are considered unique.

So, proceeding to list all unique assertions that involve prescaler:

1. Check width: 'localparam PRESCALER_WIDTH = 12;\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(prescaler) == 12);'

2. (prescaler ==0 && active) |-> ##1 tick.

6. $changed(prescaler) |-> tick.

7. (prescaler ==0) |-> ##1 tick.

11. tick |=> $stable(prescaler) until_with tick.

12. $changed(prescaler) |-> !tick.

15. (tick, p = prescaler) |-> ##(p +1) tick.

16. ($rose(active) && rst_ni, p = prescaler) |-> ##(p +1) tick.

17. tick |-> (prescaler ==0) || ##1 !tick.

Wait, 17 is the last one: 'tick_pulse_width' property, which says if tick, then either prescaler is 0 or next cycle no tick. This involves prescaler, so keep.

Now, checking which of these are unique. Let's go through them:

- The first one is unique (width check).

- Assertion 2: (prescaler ==0 && active) |-> ##1 tick.

- Assertion 7: (prescaler ==0) |-> ##1 tick. But this is similar to 2 but without the active condition. Wait, the 7th assertion says: "property zero_prescaler", which is (prescaler == 0) |-> ##1 tick. But active is part of the disable iff? Let's look at the actual code.

Original assertion 7: 

'localparam PRESCALER_WIDTH = 12;\nproperty zero_prescaler;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)\n  (prescaler == 0) |-> ##1 tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (zero_prescaler);'

So the disable iff is (!rst_ni || !active). So the property is checked only when rst_ni is high and active is high. Because disable iff stops checking when the condition is true. So if active is low, the assertion is disabled. So in this case, when active is high and prescaler is zero, then next cycle tick.

But assertion 2's code is:

'localparam PRESCALER_WIDTH = 12;\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) \n  (prescaler == 0 && active) |-> ##1 tick);'

Here, the antecedent includes active being high. So this checks that when prescaler is 0 and active is high, next cycle tick. But the 7th assertion (zero_prescaler) is enabled only when active is high (since disable iff is !active, so if active is low, the assertion is disabled). Therefore, the two assertions may overlap but are not exactly the same. So both should be kept unless they are duplicates.

But in terms of the actual logic:

- Assertion 2 says: whenever prescaler is 0 and active is high, next cycle tick.

- Assertion 7 (zero_prescaler) says: if prescaler is 0 (and active is high, because if active is low, the assertion is disabled), then next cycle tick.

So in the case where active is high, they would be the same. But assertion 2 is checking even if the disable conditions are not present. Wait, in assertion 2, there's no disable iff. So even if active goes low, the check would still fire if prescaler is 0 and active is high. But in the property zero_prescaler (assertion 7), if active is low, the assertion is disabled. So they are different. Therefore, both are unique and should be retained.

So we have to include both.

Similarly, check other assertions for uniqueness.

Another example: assertions 6 and 12.

6: $changed(prescaler) |-> tick.

12: $changed(prescaler) |-> !tick.

These are conflicting but are separate assertions. Therefore, both are present in the input list and must be considered unique.

Similarly, assertion 15 and 16:

15: prescaler_tick_period: when tick happens, the next tick is after p+1 cycles (p is prescaler at time of first tick).

16: first_tick_post_activation: after activation, the first tick is after p+1 cycles (p is prescaler at activation).

These are different scenarios.

Another point: assertion 17, which is tick_pulse_width: tick implies (prescaler is 0) or next cycle no tick. So if prescaler is 0, then tick can be high every cycle. But if prescaler is non-zero, then tick can only be high for one cycle. This ensures that when prescaler is non-zero, the tick is a single cycle pulse. This assertion was modified in the input list. The original assertion was:

Original assertion 17: 'property tick_pulse_width;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)\n  tick |-> (prescaler == 0) || ##1 !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_pulse_width);'

This checks that when tick is high, either prescaler is 0 (so tick stays high?), or next cycle, tick is low. Wait, the tick is generated by the prescaler. So if prescaler is 0, the tick would be generated every cycle. So this assertion allows tick to be high every cycle if prescaler is 0. But if prescaler is non-zero, then after a tick, the next cycle must not have a tick. That makes sense.

Now, check if any of these assertions are duplicates. For example, the assertion 'prescaler_tick_period' (15) and 'first_tick_post_activation' (16) are different because one is during normal operation and the other is after activation.

Now, compile all unique assertions related to prescaler:

1. Bit width check.

2. (prescaler ==0 && active) |-> ##1 tick.

6. $changed(prescaler) |-> tick.

7. (prescaler ==0) |-> ##1 tick (with disable iff conditions).

11. After a tick, prescaler remains stable until next tick.

12. $changed(prescaler) |-> !tick.

15. After a tick, next tick is after p+1 cycles.

16. After activation, first tick is after p+1 cycles.

17. Tick implies prescaler is 0 or next cycle no tick.

These are all the assertions that directly involve the prescaler signal.

Now, check for any missing assertions. The user mentioned that the width assertion should be present. It's already included as the first one.

Are there any other assertions related to prescaler in the list?

Looking back, another assertion in the list was 'prescaler_stable' (assertion 11):

property prescaler_stable:
  @(posedge clk) disable iff (reset or not active)
  tick |=> $stable(prescaler) until_with tick;

This means that after a tick occurs, the prescaler must remain stable until the next tick. So any changes to prescaler can only happen between ticks. This is important for the prescaler's configuration stability. So this should be included.

Another assertion is 17, which links prescaler's value to the tick's duration.

So all of the above are unique and valid.

Now, check for duplicates. For example, assertion 2 and 7 could overlap in scenarios where active is high. But the code is different, so they are considered separate.

Therefore, the final list of unique and valid assertions for 'prescaler' includes:

1. Width check.

2. prescaler ==0 and active implies next tick.

6. changed(prescaler) implies tick.

7. prescaler ==0 (with disable iff) implies next tick.

11. After tick, prescaler is stable until next tick.

12. changed(prescaler) implies no tick.

15. Tick leads to next after p+1.

16. Activation leads to first tick after p+1.

17. Tick implies prescaler 0 or next cycle no tick.

Additionally, check if any other assertions in the original list involve 'prescaler' that we might have missed.

Another one: 'prescaler_stability' (assertion 6) and 'prescaler_stability' (assertion 12) are two different properties with conflicting implications but same name. Since the user's list includes both, we have to treat them as separate. Therefore, both are included.

So all these should be in the final list.
