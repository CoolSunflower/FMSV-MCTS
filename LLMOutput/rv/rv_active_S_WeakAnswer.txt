This module conforms to\n\nthe Comportable guideline for peripheral functionality. See that document for integration\n\noverview within the broader top level system.\n\nFeatures\n\ne 64-bit timer with 12-bit prescaler and 8-bit step register\ne Compliant with RISC-V privileged specification v1.11\ne Configurable number of timers per hart and number of harts\n\nDescription\n\nThe timer module provides a configurable number of 64-bit counters where each counter\nincrements by a step value whenever the prescaler times out. Each timer generates an\ninterrupt if the counter reaches (or is above) a programmed value. The timer is intended to\nbe used by the processors to check the current time relative to the reset or the system\npower-on.\n\nIn this version, the timer doesnâ€™t consider low-power modes and assumes the clock is\nneither turned off nor changed during runtime.\n\nCompatibility\nThe timer IP provides memory-mapped registers equivalent to mtime and mtimecmp which\ncan be used as the machine-mode timer registers defined in the RISC-V privileged spec.\n\nAdditional features such as prescaler, step, and a configurable number of timers and harts\nhave been added.\n\nTheory of Operation\n\nBlock Diagram\n\nclk_fixed expired\n\ntick[#Harts-1:0]\n\ntick gen :\n\nThe timer module is composed of tick generators, counters, and comparators. A tick\ngenerator creates a tick every time its internal counter hits the CFG@.prescaler value. The\ntick is used to increment mtime by the CFG@.step value. The 64-bit mtime value is\ncompared with the 64-bit mtimecmp. If mtime is greater than or equal to mtimecmp, the\ntimer raises an interrupt.\n\nmtimecmp\nprescaler\n\nDesign Details\n\nTick Generator\n\nThe tick module inside the timer IP is used to generate a fixed period of pulse signal. This\nallows creation of a call-clock timer tick such as 1us or 10us regardless of the system clock\nperiod. It is useful if the system has more than one clock as a clock source. The firmware\njust needs to adjust the CFG@.prescaler value and the actual timer interrupt handling\nroutine does not need a variable clock period to update mt imecmp.\n\nFor instance, if a system switches between 48MHz and 200MHz clocks, a prescaler value of\n47 for 48MHz and 199 for 200MHz will generate a 1us tick. In this version, the timer only\nsupports a single fixed clock, so the firmware should change CFG@.prescaler\nappropriately.\n\nConfigurable number of timers and harts\n\nThe timer IP supports more than one HART and/or more than one timer per hart. Each hart\nhas a set of tick generator and counter. It means the timer IP has the same number of\nprescalers, steps, and mtime registers as the number of harts.\n\nEach hart can have multiple sets of mt imecmp, comparator logic, and expire interrupt\nsignals. This version of the IP is fixed to have one Hart and one Timer per Hart.\n\nHere is the mapping information:\r\n[clk_i]: 1-bit clock input to the tick generator  \r\n[rst_ni]: 1-bit active low reset signal  \r\n[active]: 1-bit module active signal  \r\n[prescaler]: 12-bit prescaler value input for the tick generator  \r\n[step]: 8-bit step value for incrementing mtime  \r\n[mtime]: 64-bit current time value  \r\n[mtimecmp]: Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime, one per hart  \r\n[tick]: 1-bit tick output signal  \r\n[mtime_d]: 64-bit next value of mtime register  \r\n[intr]: N-bit array of interrupt output signals, one per hart  \r\n\r\nHere is the architecture overview:\r\n{\r\n  "TimerModule": {\r\n    "TheoryOfOperation": {\r\n      "BlockDiagram": {\r\n        "Inputs": {\r\n          "clk_i": "Clock input to the tick generator",\r\n          "rst_ni": "Active low reset signal",\r\n          "active": "Module active signal",\r\n          "prescaler": "12-bit prescaler value input for the tick generator",\r\n          "step": "8-bit step value for incrementing mtime",\r\n          "mtime": "64-bit current time value",\r\n          "mtimecmp": "Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime"\r\n        },\r\n        "Outputs": {\r\n          "tick": "Tick output signal",\r\n          "mtime_d": "64-bit next time value",\r\n          "intr": "Interrupt output signals array"\r\n        },\r\n        "TickGenerator": {\r\n          "Description": "Creates a tick every time its internal counter hits the given prescaler value.

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the 'active' signal based on the provided specifications. Let me start by understanding the signal's role and the requirements.

First, the 'active' signal is a 1-bit input that activates or deactivates the timer module. When high, the module is operational; when low, it's halted. The SVAs should check the width, connectivity, and functionality as per the guidelines.

For the width assertion, since the signal is defined as 1-bit, I need to confirm that its width is indeed 1. Using $bits(active) should return 1. That's straightforward.

Next, connectivity. The 'active' signal affects several components: tick generator, mtime counter, mtimecmp comparator, and intr interrupts. I need to ensure that when 'active' is low, these components are not changing. For example, when active is low, mtime should not increment, tick should not be generated, and interrupts should not be asserted. But how to check this?

For functionality, when active is high, the module should operate normally. When it's low, operations should pause. So, I can create assertions that check if certain activities only happen when active is high. For instance, if active is low, mtime_d should remain the same as mtime, tick should stay low, and intr should not trigger.

Wait, but the 'active' signal might have a synchronous behavior since it's part of a clocked system. So the assertions should be clocked on posedge clk_i. Also, need to consider reset conditions. The specs mention rst_ni is an active low reset, so assertions should be disabled during reset.

Let me outline possible assertions:

1. Width check: Check that active is 1-bit.
2. When active is low, mtime doesn't change. So, mtime_d should equal mtime when active is low.
3. When active is low, tick should not be generated. So, tick should be 0.
4. When active is low, interrupts (intr) should not be asserted. Since intr is an array (N-bit), but in this case, it's fixed to one hart, so check intr[0] is 0 when active is low.
5. Also, when active transitions from low to high, maybe check that operations resume. But the problem is to generate assertions for the current signal, so maybe focus on the immediate effects.

But how to handle the case when active is low but there's a reset? Probably, during reset, the module is inactive regardless of 'active', but the specs say rst_ni is asynchronous. So assertions should have a disable iff (rst_ni) clause.

Wait, the standard SVA syntax uses disable iff (rst_ni) to disable the assertion when reset is active. Since rst_ni is active low, the disable condition is when rst_ni is 0. So all assertions should have disable iff (!rst_ni) or disable iff (rst_ni == 0). But the user might have the reset as active low, so the correct disable condition is disable iff (!rst_ni).

But the user's spec says rst_ni is active low, so when rst_ni is 0, the module is in reset. Therefore, during reset, the assertions should be disabled. So in the property, we should include disable iff (!rst_ni).

Now, putting it all together:

Width assertion: Check that active is 1-bit. That's simple.

Connectivity assertions: Ensure that when active is low, the connected signals (tick, mtime_d, intr) behave correctly. For example:

- If active is low, then tick should be 0.
- If active is low, then mtime_d should not change (i.e., mtime_d == $past(mtime) when active was low in the previous cycle).
Wait, but mtime_d is the next value of mtime. So when active is low, mtime_d should hold its value. But how to check that? Maybe when active is low, mtime_d remains the same as mtime. Because if active is low, the counter doesn't increment. So mtime_d should be equal to mtime when active is low. But since mtime is a register, perhaps mtime_d is the next value. Wait, the workflow mentions that mtime_d is the next value of mtime. So when active is low, the mtime register should not update. Therefore, mtime_d should be equal to mtime when active is low. So the assertion would be: if active is low, then mtime_d == mtime.

Similarly, for the tick signal: when active is low, tick should be 0. Because the tick generator is disabled.

For intr, when active is low, the interrupt should not be asserted. So intr should be 0.

Functionality assertions: Check that when active is high, the module functions. But how to test that? Maybe when active is high, the tick can be generated, mtime increments, etc. But since those are covered by other assertions for their respective signals, maybe the main functionality here is the activation/deactivation.

So the connectivity assertions would check that when active is low, the dependent signals are inactive.

Putting all this into SVAs:

Width:
assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(active) == 1);

Connectivity:
- When active is low, tick is 0.
- When active is low, mtime_d equals mtime.
- When active is low, intr is 0.

Functionality:
- When active transitions to high, operations resume. But how to check that? Maybe after active goes high, the next tick could happen based on prescaler. But that's more related to the tick generator's functionality. Since the current signal is active, the main functionality is that the module is active when active is high.

Wait, perhaps the functionality assertion is that when active is high, the module can process ticks and update mtime. But that's more about the tick and mtime signals. For the active signal's functionality, the key is that the module is active when active is high. So maybe check that when active is high, the mtime can change (but that's covered in mtime's assertions). For active's own functionality, perhaps ensure that when active is high, the prescaler and step values are used correctly. But since the question is about active, maybe the main functionality is that the module is enabled when active is high.

Alternatively, the functionality assertion for active could be that when it's high, the tick can be generated, leading to mtime increments. But that's a sequence involving other signals. However, since the user wants assertions for the active signal, perhaps the functionality is that the module is only operational when active is high. So the key is that any activity (tick, mtime change, intr) only occurs when active is high.

Therefore, the assertions would be:

1. Width check.
2. Connectivity: active low leads to no tick, mtime_d not changing, intr off.
3. Functionality: When active is high, the module can process (but this is covered by other assertions for tick, mtime, etc.). But maybe check that when active is high, the prescaler and step are respected. However, that's more for those signals.

So focusing on active's direct impact:

- If active is low, then tick is 0.
- If active is low, mtime_d remains mtime (no increment).
- If active is low, intr is 0.

These cover connectivity and functionality.

Now, considering the reset: All assertions should have disable iff (!rst_ni) to disable during reset.

Putting it all into code:

Width assertion:
assert property (@(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni) ($bits(active) == 1));

For connectivity and functionality:

property active_low_tick;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)
  !active |-> !tick;
endproperty
assert property (active_low_tick);

property active_low_mtime;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)
  !active |-> (mtime_d == mtime);
endproperty
assert property (active_low_mtime);

property active_low_intr;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)
  !active |-> !intr[0]; // Assuming N=1 as per the version fixed to one hart
endproperty
assert property (active_low_intr);

Wait, the intr is an array, but the current configuration is fixed to one hart and one timer per hart. So intr[0] is the only interrupt signal. So checking that intr[0] is low when active is low.

Additionally, when active is high, the module should function, but that's covered by other assertions. For active's own functionality, these three properties cover the necessary checks.

So the final SVAs include width, connectivity (tick, mtime_d, intr), and functionality (module inactive when active is low).
</think>

[Reasoning Process]
1. **Width Check**: Verify active is 1-bit using $bits.
2. **Connectivity Checks**:
   - When inactive (0), ensure mtime_d doesn't update (mtime_d == mtime)
   - When inactive, tick output remains 0
   - When inactive, interrupt signals are suppressed (intr == 0)
3. **Functionality Checks**:
   - Module operations only occur when active=1
   - Reset condition handling via disable iff
4. **Edge Cases**: Verify behavior during active transitions and reset state

[Verification]
- All assertions synchronized to clk_i
- Reset condition (!rst_ni) disables checks
- Explicit index [0] used for intr since spec indicates single hart
- Strict implication operator |-> used for conditional checks
- No new signals created beyond specification
