Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to correct the syntax of the provided SystemVerilog assertions related to the 'tick' signal, ensuring compliance with the given Timer HWIP specification and addressing the errors encountered in the Jasper logs.

First, I need to understand the original assertions and the errors they caused. The initial assertion tried to use a local variable 'cycle_count' within the property, which led to an error about local variable assignment in a non-supported position. Jasper doesn't support that, so I need an alternative approach.

Looking at the error messages, the first attempt had an issue with the implication's right-hand side having a local variable. The second and third attempts tried different approaches but faced issues with 'prescaler' not being a constant. That suggests that 'prescaler' might be a variable in the design, not a parameter, so using it in a sequence like ##(prescaler) isn't allowed because the delay must be a constant.

The Timer HWIP spec mentions a 12-bit prescaler, which is part of the configuration. The tick generator uses this prescaler to determine the period. The corrected assertion needs to check that once a tick occurs, the next tick happens exactly after (prescaler + 1) clock cycles, considering that the prescaler counts from 0 to the configured value.

Since 'prescaler' is a runtime-configurable register, using it directly in a fixed delay like ##(prescaler) isn't feasible because SVA requires delays to be constants. However, the spec says that in this version, the timer uses a fixed clock, and firmware should set the prescaler appropriately. So perhaps the prescaler is static during operation, but in the design, it's still a variable.

Alternative approach: Instead of using a variable prescaler value in the assertion, maybe the prescaler is a parameter. Wait, the user mentioned that we can add localparam if needed. But the spec says prescaler is a 12-bit register, so it's not a parameter. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, the error in the second attempt was that 'prescaler' is not a constant. So the tool expects a constant value in the sequence. To fix this, perhaps the assertion should be written in a way that doesn't require a variable prescaler in the sequence. Maybe using a repetition with a local variable that counts up to prescaler.

But the initial attempt used a local variable in the property, which caused the error. Jasper might not support local variables in that context. So another approach is needed.

Let me think about the tick generation. The tick is generated every (prescaler + 1) cycles. So when the tick rises, the next tick should occur after (prescaler + 1) cycles. The assertion needs to check that between two consecutive ticks, exactly (prescaler + 1) clock cycles have passed.

One way to model this without using a variable prescaler in the delay is to use a sequence that checks that after a tick, the next tick occurs exactly after (prescaler + 1) cycles. But since prescaler is a variable, this isn't directly possible. However, if the prescaler is static during the assertion's evaluation (which it might be, as per the spec's note that the clock is fixed and firmware sets it once), maybe we can capture the prescaler value at the start of the sequence.

Wait, the spec says: "In this version, the timer only supports a single fixed clock, so the firmware should change CFG@.prescaler appropriately." So the prescaler can be changed by firmware, but once set, it's expected to remain constant. However, in the design, it's still a register, so the tool might treat it as a variable.

Given that, the assertion needs to account for the current value of prescaler when the tick occurs. But using a variable in the delay is not allowed. So perhaps the solution is to use a sequence that, upon a tick, checks that the next tick happens after the current prescaler value + 1 cycles.

But how to do that in SVA? One approach is to use a local variable to capture the prescaler value at the time of the tick and then check the delay based on that captured value.

Wait, the original code tried that with cycle_count, but the tool didn't support the assignment in the RHS. Let me revisit the original code:

property tick_periodicity;
  int cycle_count;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  ($rose(tick), cycle_count=0) 
  |-> (1, cycle_count++)[*1:$] ##0 (tick && (cycle_count == prescaler + 1));
endproperty

The error was about local variable assignment in a non-supported position. Maybe the tool doesn't allow the (1, cycle_count++)[*1:$] part because it's in the consequent of the implication.

An alternative is to restructure the property to capture the prescaler value when the tick occurs and then check that after that many cycles, the next tick comes.

So, here's an idea: when a tick occurs, sample the current prescaler value into a local variable, then check that after (captured_prescaler + 1) cycles, the next tick occurs.

But in SVA, local variables can be passed through sequences. Let's try:

property tick_periodicity;
  int p;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  ($rose(tick), p = prescaler) |-> ##(p + 1) $rose(tick);
endproperty

But wait, if prescaler is a variable, then ##(p + 1) would require p to be a constant, which it's not. Because 'p' is a local variable that captures the value of prescaler at the time of the antecedent. However, in SVA, the delay in ##delay must be a constant, not a variable. So this approach won't work.

Hmm, this is a problem. So how can we model a variable delay based on a signal's value?

Alternative approach: Use a sequence that counts the number of cycles between ticks and ensures it matches the prescaler + 1.

But without using local variables in the consequent, which the tool might not support.

Another idea: Use an implication where the antecedent is the rising edge of tick, and the consequent is a sequence that checks that for the next (prescaler +1) cycles, tick is low, and then on the (prescaler +1)th cycle, tick is high again.

But again, since prescaler is a variable, we can't use it directly in the repetition count.

Wait, maybe the prescaler is a signal that can be referenced in the sequence. So, perhaps using a consecutive check that between two ticks, the number of cycles is equal to the prescaler + 1.

But how to express that in SVA without using local variables.

Alternatively, use a property that after a tick, the next tick occurs exactly after (prescaler +1) cycles. But since prescaler can change, this might not hold. However, according to the spec, the prescaler is supposed to be set by firmware and remain constant during operation. So maybe the assertion can assume that prescaler doesn't change between ticks.

But the tool doesn't know that, so the assertion has to account for possible changes in prescaler.

This is getting complicated. Let's look at the corrected attempts the user tried:

In one of the later attempts, they used:

property tick_periodicity;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  (tick && (prescaler > 0)) |-> ##(prescaler) tick;
endproperty

But this would have the same issue because ##(prescaler) requires a constant.

Another attempt used:

(tick && (prescaler > 0)) |-> ##1 ((1[*0:$] ##1 tick) [*prescaler]);

But again, the repetition [*prescaler] requires a constant.

So the core issue is that the prescaler is a variable, and the tool expects constants in the repetition counts or delays.

Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to model the tick periodicity without relying on the prescaler value in the sequence, but instead using the fact that the tick should occur every (prescaler +1) cycles. However, since the prescaler can change, this might not be straightforward.

Wait, the spec says that in this version, the timer only supports a single fixed clock, and the firmware should set the prescaler appropriately. So perhaps once the timer is active, the prescaler is not changed. If that's the case, then the prescaler can be treated as a constant during the operation of the timer, and the assertion can use a localparam for the prescaler value. But the problem is that the prescaler is a register in the design, not a parameter.

Alternatively, maybe the prescaler is configured once and remains constant, so the assertion can sample its initial value. But that's not reliable.

Alternatively, the user might have intended for the prescaler to be a parameter, but according to the spec, it's a 12-bit register. So that's not the case.

This seems like a dead end. However, the user mentioned that we can add localparam if needed. Maybe the prescaler is supposed to be a parameter in the module, but in the provided code, it's a signal. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the spec.

Wait, looking back at the spec's features: "e 64-bit timer with 12-bit prescaler and 8-bit step register". The prescaler is part of the configuration registers, which suggests it's a writable register, not a parameter.

Given that, the original approach using a local variable to count cycles might be necessary, but the tool doesn't support it. So perhaps the correct way is to avoid using local variables in the consequent and instead structure the assertion differently.

Another approach: Use a sequence that starts at the rising edge of tick, counts (prescaler +1) cycles, and checks for the next tick. But again, the prescaler is a variable.

Wait, maybe the prescaler is a static configuration, so once set, it doesn't change. If that's the case, the assertion can capture the prescaler value when the module is active and use that. But how?

Alternatively, use an assumption that the prescaler doesn't change during operation, but the user hasn't mentioned that.

Alternatively, use a generate loop to create assertions for each possible prescaler value, but that's impractical for a 12-bit value.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let's look for examples of similar assertions.

In the Jasper logs, the user tried a property that uses a local variable to count cycles, but the tool rejected it. The error was about local variable assignment in the RHS of the implication.

Maybe the correct approach is to move the cycle counting into the antecedent. For example:

property tick_periodicity;
  int cycle_count;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  ($rose(tick), cycle_count=0) 
  ##0 (1, cycle_count++)[*0:$] ##1 tick |-> cycle_count == prescaler + 1;
endproperty

But I'm not sure if this is valid. The sequence before the |-> would start at the first tick, then count cycles until the next tick, and then check that the count equals prescaler +1. However, the [*0:$] allows any number of cycles, but the sequence would end when tick occurs again. Then, the check is that cycle_count equals prescaler +1.

But how to structure this correctly. Maybe:

sequence count_cycles;
  int cnt;
  (1, cnt = 0) ##0 (1, cnt++)[*0:$];
endsequence

property tick_periodicity;
  int cnt;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  $rose(tick) ##0 count_cycles.trigger(cnt) ##1 $rose(tick) |-> cnt == prescaler + 1;
endproperty

But I'm not sure about the syntax here. Alternatively, use a sequence with a local variable that accumulates the count between ticks.

Another approach: Use the 'within' construct. For example, between two consecutive ticks, the number of cycles should be prescaler +1.

But how to express that.

Alternatively, use the $past function. After a tick, check that the previous tick was prescaler +1 cycles ago. But this might not work for the first tick.

Alternatively, use a property that whenever a tick occurs, the previous tick was exactly (prescaler +1) cycles ago. But this would require checking the past, which might be possible with $past.

Wait, here's an idea:

property tick_periodicity;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  $rose(tick) |-> ($past(tick, prescaler +1) && ($countones(tick[->prescaler +1]) == 1));
endproperty

But this is not correct. The $past function here would look back (prescaler +1) cycles, which is a variable, and that's not allowed. The argument to $past must be a constant.

Hmm. This is really challenging. Let's think differently. The tick is generated when the internal counter reaches the prescaler value. The internal counter increments each clock cycle. So, the tick occurs when the counter is equal to the prescaler, and then the counter resets to 0. So the period is (prescaler +1) cycles.

So, the assertion needs to check that between two consecutive ticks, there are exactly (prescaler) cycles in between. Wait, no: if the counter starts at 0 and counts up to prescaler, that's (prescaler +1) cycles. For example, prescaler=0: count 0 → tick, next cycle count 0 again. So the period is 1 cycle.

So, the tick should occur every (prescaler +1) cycles. Therefore, the time between two consecutive ticks is (prescaler +1) cycles.

Given that, the assertion should check that after a tick, the next tick occurs exactly after (prescaler +1) cycles. But since prescaler can change, this is only valid if prescaler remains constant between ticks.

Assuming that the prescaler doesn't change once the timer is active (as per the spec's note that the clock is fixed and firmware sets it), then the assertion can be written as:

property tick_periodicity;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  $rose(tick) |=> ##(prescaler) $rose(tick);
endproperty

But again, ##(prescaler) requires a constant. So this won't work.

Alternative idea: Use a sequence that, after a tick, checks that for the next (prescaler) cycles, there's no tick, and then on the (prescaler +1)th cycle, there is a tick.

But how to express that with a variable prescaler.

Wait, maybe using a recursive property. For example:

property tick_periodicity(p);
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  (p > 0) and ($rose(tick) |=> (!tick throughout (p)) ##1 $rose(tick));
endproperty

But again, 'p' here would need to be a parameter, not a variable.

Alternatively, use a local variable to capture the prescaler value at the time of the tick and then check the sequence based on that.

property tick_periodicity;
  int p;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  ($rose(tick), p = prescaler) |-> ##(p + 1) $rose(tick);
endproperty

But this would require 'p' to be a constant in the ## delay, which it's not. So this is invalid.

Given all these constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to use an assertion that doesn't directly reference the prescaler value but instead infers the periodicity through the tick signal. However, without knowing the prescaler value, this isn't possible.

Wait, the user's final attempt was:

property tick_periodicity;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  (tick && (prescaler > 0)) |-> ##1 ((1[*0:$] ##1 tick) [*prescaler]);
endproperty

But this also uses 'prescaler' in the repetition, which is a variable, leading to an error.

Given that the Jasper tool doesn't support variable repetitions or delays, the only way to write this assertion is to assume that the prescaler is a parameter. However, according to the spec, it's a register. This seems like a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the prescaler is a parameter in the module. The spec says it's a 12-bit prescaler, but maybe in the actual implementation, it's a parameter. Let me check the spec again.

The spec says: "Configurable number of timers per hart and number of harts". The prescaler is part of the configuration registers, which implies it's a writable register, not a parameter. Therefore, the prescaler is a signal in the design, not a parameter.

This means that any assertion that references 'prescaler' as a variable in a sequence that requires a constant value (like ##delay or [*n]) will fail.

Given this, the correct approach might be to use a localparam for the prescaler value in the assertion, but that contradicts the spec. However, the user mentioned that we can add localparam if needed. So perhaps the solution is to declare a localparam in the assertion module that mirrors the prescaler value.

But how would that work if the prescaler is dynamic? It wouldn't. Unless the prescaler is static, which the spec implies when it says the firmware should set it appropriately for the fixed clock.

Wait, the spec says: "In this version, the timer only supports a single fixed clock, so the firmware should change CFG@.prescaler appropriately." So the prescaler is set once by firmware to a value that matches the fixed clock. Once set, it remains constant. Therefore, during normal operation, the prescaler is a constant value.

If that's the case, then the assertion can safely use the prescaler value as a constant. However, in the design, it's still a register, so the tool sees it as a variable. This is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the prescaler is a parameter in the module. But the spec says it's part of the configuration registers, which are writable.

This is a dead end. Given the tool's limitations and the spec's requirements, the correct assertion might need to use a localparam for the prescaler value, assuming that it's set correctly. But this is a workaround.

Alternatively, the user might have intended for the prescaler to be a parameter, and the documentation is incorrect. But I have to work with the given information.

Given the user's instruction that we can add localparam if needed, here's a possible solution:

Declare a localparam in the assertion module that captures the expected prescaler value. Then, use that localparam in the assertion.

But how to get the correct value? This seems like a kludge, but perhaps the user expects this.

Alternatively, the prescaler is a parameter in the module, and the documentation's mention of it being a register is a mistake. In that case, the assertion can use a parameter.

Assuming that, here's the corrected assertion:

localparam PRESCALER = 12'hXXX; // Replace with actual value

property tick_periodicity;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  $rose(tick) |-> ##(PRESCALER + 1) $rose(tick);
endproperty
assert property (tick_periodicity);

But the user might not know the actual prescaler value, so this isn't feasible.

Alternatively, the user might have intended for the prescaler to be a parameter, and the error in the Jasper log about 'prescaler' not being a constant is because it's a variable in the design. Therefore, the correct approach is to reference a parameter instead.

But without modifying the design, this isn't possible. The user's constraints say we can't create new signals, but we can add localparams.

Wait, the user said: "You are allowed to have parameters if needed. The only constraint being you are not allowed to create any new signals than the ones specified in the specification."

So, perhaps the solution is to declare a localparam in the assertion module that is set to the prescaler's value. However, this would require that the prescaler is a parameter in the design, which it's not according to the spec.

This is conflicting. Given the Jasper errors, the tool expects 'prescaler' to be a constant, but in the design, it's a variable. Therefore, the assertion cannot directly use 'prescaler' in a sequence that requires a constant.

The only way around this is to write an assertion that doesn't use the prescaler value in the sequence but instead infers the correct periodicity through the tick signal. For example, check that between two consecutive ticks, the number of cycles is consistent. But without knowing the expected number, this isn't possible.

Alternatively, use an auxiliary counter in the assertion that counts cycles between ticks and checks against the prescaler value. But this would require a new signal, which is not allowed.

Given all these constraints, the correct answer must be to rewrite the assertion without using the prescaler in a variable context. The only feasible way is to use a local variable to count the cycles between ticks and compare it to the prescaler +1, but ensure that the tool supports the local variable assignment.

Looking back at the original error: "ERROR (EOBS012): ./sva/rv/rv.sv(23): Not supported: Assert with local variable assignment in non supported position: Implicaton right-hand side or other non negative environment."

The issue is that the local variable is assigned in the consequent of the implication. To fix this, the assignment should be in the antecedent.

Here's a revised version of the original property:

property tick_periodicity;
  int cycle_count;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  ($rose(tick), cycle_count=0) ##0 (1, cycle_count++)[*1:$] ##0 $rose(tick) |-> cycle_count == prescaler + 1;
endproperty

But this structure starts with the first tick, counts cycles until the next tick, and then checks that the count equals prescaler +1. The sequence before the |-> is ($rose(tick), cycle_count=0) followed by any number of cycles where cycle_count increments, then another $rose(tick). The implication is that when this sequence happens, cycle_count must equal prescaler +1.

This way, the local variable is assigned in the antecedent, and the check is in the consequent. However, the tool might still not support this if the [*1:$] is in the antecedent.

Alternatively, use a sequence to capture the cycle count:

sequence count_cycles(signal, ref int count);
  ((1, count++)[*0:$]) ##1 signal;
endsequence

property tick_periodicity;
  int cycle_count;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  ($rose(tick), cycle_count=0) ##0 count_cycles($rose(tick), cycle_count) |-> cycle_count == prescaler + 1;
endproperty

But I'm not sure if this is valid syntax. The sequence count_cycles would increment 'count' each cycle until 'signal' (next $rose(tick)) occurs. Then, the property checks that the total count is prescaler +1.

This might work, but depends on tool support for passing variables by reference in sequences.

Given that the original error was about local variable assignment in the RHS, moving the assignment to the antecedent might resolve it. Let's try structuring the property as:

property tick_periodicity;
  int cycle_count;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  ($rose(tick), cycle_count=0) ##0 (1, cycle_count++)[*0:$] ##1 $rose(tick) |-> cycle_count == prescaler + 1;
endproperty

Here, the antecedent is the sequence starting with the first tick, followed by any number of cycles (each incrementing cycle_count), and then another tick. The consequent checks that cycle_count equals prescaler +1.

This way, the local variable is assigned and incremented in the antecedent, and the check is in the consequent. This might be acceptable to the tool.

However, the [*0:$] allows zero or more cycles, but we need exactly (prescaler +1) -1 cycles between the two ticks. Because the first tick is at cycle 0, then (prescaler +1) cycles later is the next tick. So the number of cycles between the two ticks is (prescaler +1) -1 = prescaler. Wait, no: if the first tick is at time T, the next tick is at T + (prescaler +1) cycles. So the number of cycles between them is (prescaler +1). But in the sequence, the first tick is at T, then we have (prescaler +1) cycles until the next tick. So the cycle_count should be (prescaler +1).

But in the sequence above, cycle_count starts at 0, then increments each cycle. So after (prescaler +1) cycles, cycle_count would be (prescaler +1). So the check is correct.

This approach might resolve the tool's issue because the local variable is assigned in the antecedent. However, the tool might still not support the [*0:$] with a local variable increment.

If this is still problematic, another approach is to use a helper sequence with a local variable:

sequence tick_sequence(ref int cnt);
  ($rose(tick), cnt = 0) ##1 (!tick[->1], cnt++)[*0:$] ##1 $rose(tick);
endsequence

property tick_periodicity;
  int cnt;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  tick_sequence(cnt) |-> cnt == prescaler;
endproperty

This sequence starts with a tick, then counts the number of cycles until the next tick, excluding the cycle where the tick occurs. The cnt would be the number of cycles between ticks, which should equal prescaler. But according to the spec, the period is (prescaler +1) cycles, so cnt should be prescaler.

But this depends on how the prescaler is implemented. If the prescaler counts from 0 to prescaler_value, then the number of cycles is prescaler_value +1. So the cnt in this sequence would be prescaler_value.

Thus, the assertion checks that the number of cycles between ticks is prescaler_value, which matches the spec's behavior.

This approach uses a helper sequence with a local variable to count the cycles between ticks and checks against the prescaler value. Since the prescaler is a register, this should work as long as the tool allows local variables in sequences.

Given the user's constraints and the Jasper errors, this might be the correct solution. The key is to structure the assertion such that the local variable is assigned and used within the sequence, and the check is in the consequent.

So, the corrected assertion would be:

property tick_periodicity;
  int cnt;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  ($rose(tick), cnt=0) ##1 (!tick throughout (1, cnt++)[*0:$] ##1 $rose(tick)) |-> cnt == prescaler;
endproperty
assert property (tick_periodicity);

But I'm not sure about the syntax of the 'throughout' operator here. Alternatively, use a sequence that captures the count:

sequence count_between_ticks(ref int cnt);
  ($rose(tick), cnt=0) ##1 (!tick ##0 (1, cnt++)[*0:$]) ##1 $rose(tick);
endsequence

property tick_periodicity;
  int cnt;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  count_between_ticks(cnt) |-> cnt == prescaler;
endproperty
assert property (tick_periodicity);

This sequence starts when a tick rises, resets cnt to 0, then on each subsequent cycle where tick is low, increments cnt, until the next tick rises. Then, the property checks that cnt equals the prescaler value. Since the prescaler value is the number of cycles between ticks (as the period is prescaler +1), this should be correct.

This approach avoids using the prescaler in a delay or repetition count, instead using it in a comparison after capturing the actual cycle count. This should resolve the tool's syntax issues.
