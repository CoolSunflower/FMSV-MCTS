This module conforms to\n\nthe Comportable guideline for peripheral functionality. See that document for integration\n\noverview within the broader top level system.\n\nFeatures\n\ne 64-bit timer with 12-bit prescaler and 8-bit step register\ne Compliant with RISC-V privileged specification v1.11\ne Configurable number of timers per hart and number of harts\n\nDescription\n\nThe timer module provides a configurable number of 64-bit counters where each counter\nincrements by a step value whenever the prescaler times out. Each timer generates an\ninterrupt if the counter reaches (or is above) a programmed value. The timer is intended to\nbe used by the processors to check the current time relative to the reset or the system\npower-on.\n\nIn this version, the timer doesn’t consider low-power modes and assumes the clock is\nneither turned off nor changed during runtime.\n\nCompatibility\nThe timer IP provides memory-mapped registers equivalent to mtime and mtimecmp which\ncan be used as the machine-mode timer registers defined in the RISC-V privileged spec.\n\nAdditional features such as prescaler, step, and a configurable number of timers and harts\nhave been added.\n\nTheory of Operation\n\nBlock Diagram\n\nclk_fixed expired\n\ntick[#Harts-1:0]\n\ntick gen :\n\nThe timer module is composed of tick generators, counters, and comparators. A tick\ngenerator creates a tick every time its internal counter hits the CFG@.prescaler value. The\ntick is used to increment mtime by the CFG@.step value. The 64-bit mtime value is\ncompared with the 64-bit mtimecmp. If mtime is greater than or equal to mtimecmp, the\ntimer raises an interrupt.\n\nmtimecmp\nprescaler\n\nDesign Details\n\nTick Generator\n\nThe tick module inside the timer IP is used to generate a fixed period of pulse signal. This\nallows creation of a call-clock timer tick such as 1us or 10us regardless of the system clock\nperiod. It is useful if the system has more than one clock as a clock source. The firmware\njust needs to adjust the CFG@.prescaler value and the actual timer interrupt handling\nroutine does not need a variable clock period to update mt imecmp.\n\nFor instance, if a system switches between 48MHz and 200MHz clocks, a prescaler value of\n47 for 48MHz and 199 for 200MHz will generate a 1us tick. In this version, the timer only\nsupports a single fixed clock, so the firmware should change CFG@.prescaler\nappropriately.\n\nConfigurable number of timers and harts\n\nThe timer IP supports more than one HART and/or more than one timer per hart. Each hart\nhas a set of tick generator and counter. It means the timer IP has the same number of\nprescalers, steps, and mtime registers as the number of harts.\n\nEach hart can have multiple sets of mt imecmp, comparator logic, and expire interrupt\nsignals. This version of the IP is fixed to have one Hart and one Timer per Hart.\n\nHere is the mapping information:\r\n[clk_i]: 1-bit clock input to the tick generator  \r\n[rst_ni]: 1-bit active low reset signal  \r\n[active]: 1-bit module active signal  \r\n[prescaler]: 12-bit prescaler value input for the tick generator  \r\n[step]: 8-bit step value for incrementing mtime  \r\n[mtime]: 64-bit current time value  \r\n[mtimecmp]: Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime, one per hart  \r\n[tick]: 1-bit tick output signal  \r\n[mtime_d]: 64-bit next value of mtime register  \r\n[intr]: N-bit array of interrupt output signals, one per hart  \r\n\r\nHere is the architecture overview:\r\n{\r\n  "TimerModule": {\r\n    "TheoryOfOperation": {\r\n      "BlockDiagram": {\r\n        "Inputs": {\r\n          "clk_i": "Clock input to the tick generator",\r\n          "rst_ni": "Active low reset signal",\r\n          "active": "Module active signal",\r\n          "prescaler": "12-bit prescaler value input for the tick generator",\r\n          "step": "8-bit step value for incrementing mtime",\r\n          "mtime": "64-bit current time value",\r\n          "mtimecmp": "Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime"\r\n        },\r\n        "Outputs": {\r\n          "tick": "Tick output signal",\r\n          "mtime_d": "64-bit next time value",\r\n          "intr": "Interrupt output signals array"\r\n        },\r\n        "TickGenerator": {\r\n          "Description": "Creates a tick every time its internal counter hits the given prescaler value.

Let\'s start by understanding the signal\'s role and the requirements.\n\nFirst, the signal is a 1-bit active-low asynchronous reset. The width assertion is straightforward: check that rst_ni is indeed 1 bit. That\'s simple with $bits(rst_ni) == 1.\n\nNext, connectivity. The reset is connected to all major components. So, when rst_ni is low, those components should reset. For example, mtime should reset to 0, mtimecmp to its default (maybe 0?), and intr should deassert. But how to check this? Maybe when reset is active, these signals should hold their reset values. Also, since it\'s asynchronous, the reset should take effect immediately, not just on clock edges. But SVAs are clock-based, so I need to use properties that trigger on any change in rst_ni.\n\nFunctionality: When rst_ni is low, the module resets. When it\'s high, normal operation. So assertions should check that during reset, internal signals are in their reset state. Also, after reset deasserts, the module should start functioning normally. But since the reset is asynchronous, the assertions need to capture that the reset state is maintained as long as rst_ni is low, regardless of the clock.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width check: Ensure rst_ni is 1 bit.\n2. When rst_ni is low, mtime is 0. But wait, the spec says "initializes internal components" but doesn\'t specify the reset value of mtime. Hmm. The problem says not to assume anything not provided. The description mentions that reset initializes to a known state, but the exact value isn\'t given. Maybe I can\'t assert specific values unless specified. Wait, the user provided "Resets the tick generator, mtime, mtimecmp, and interrupt logic." So maybe mtime resets to 0, mtimecmp to some default (maybe 0?), and intr to 0. But the spec doesn\'t give exact reset values. Hmm. Maybe the intr should be 0 during reset. But the problem says not to make up info. So perhaps connectivity checks are about the reset affecting those signals, but without knowing exact values, maybe check that when reset is active, certain behaviors happen. For example, when reset is low, the next mtime_d should be 0 (since mtime is reset). But the workflow mentions that when a tick occurs, mtime increments by step. So during reset, the tick shouldn\'t affect mtime. Also, the intr should be deasserted during reset.\n\nWait, the spec says "ensures a known default state upon reset." So maybe the default state is that mtime is 0, mtimecmp is 0, and intr is 0. But without explicit info, maybe I can\'t assume that. Alternatively, perhaps the connectivity assertion is that when reset is active, the outputs (like intr) are deasserted. Since intr is an output, and reset is active low, when rst_ni is 0, intr should be 0. That\'s a connectivity check.\n\nAnother point: asynchronous reset. So when rst_ni goes low, the reset should take effect immediately, not waiting for a clock edge. But in SVAs, properties are checked at clock edges. So how to model that? Maybe check that whenever rst_ni is low, regardless of the clock, certain conditions hold. But since the SVA is clocked, perhaps using $global_clock or something else. Wait, but the user\'s examples use posedge clk_i. But since the reset is asynchronous, maybe the assertions should check that whenever reset is active, the signals are in reset state, regardless of the clock. But in practice, SVAs are clocked. So perhaps the assertions should check that at any clock edge, if reset is active, then the signals are in reset state. Also, check that when reset is asserted asynchronously, the signals immediately reset.\n\nBut how to model asynchronous behavior in SVAs? One approach is to use a checker that triggers on the reset signal\'s change. But SVAs are typically clocked. Alternatively, use a sequence that checks the reset condition at any time, but that\'s not standard. Maybe the best approach is to check that whenever reset is low, the next clock edge sees the signals in their reset state. But that\'s synchronous. However, the reset is asynchronous, so the signals should reset immediately. But in simulation, the signals would change as soon as reset is asserted, even between clock edges. But SVAs can\'t check between clock edges. So perhaps the assertions are written to check that at the next clock edge after reset is asserted, the signals are in reset state. But that\'s not capturing the asynchronous aspect. Hmm. Maybe the user expects that when reset is low, regardless of the clock, the signals are in their reset state. But how to write that in SVA.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of immediate assertions, but the user specified to use SVA. So perhaps the connectivity assertions are that when reset is active, the outputs are in their reset state. For example, intr should be 0 when reset is active, and this should hold at every clock edge where reset is active.\n\nSo, for connectivity:\n\n- When rst_ni is low, intr is 0.\n- When rst_ni is low, mtime_d is 0 (assuming reset clears mtime_d).\nBut the spec says "Resets the tick generator, mtime, mtimecmp, and interrupt logic." So mtime would reset to 0, so mtime_d (the next value) would be 0. But mtime_d is the next value of mtime. So during reset, mtime_d should be 0. Also, the tick generator is reset, so the internal counter for the prescaler should reset, so the tick output should not be generated during reset. So maybe when reset is active, tick is 0.\n\nBut the problem says not to create new signals. The given signals for rst_ni are clk_i, mtime, mtimecmp, intr. So connectivity assertions could check that when reset is active, intr is 0, mtime is 0 (if that\'s the reset value), but the spec doesn\'t explicitly state the reset values. Wait, the description says "ensures a known default state upon reset." So maybe the default state is that mtime is 0, mtimecmp is 0, and intr is 0. But the user hasn\'t provided exact reset values. Hmm. This is a problem. Without knowing the exact reset values, it\'s hard to write exact assertions. But the user says to base on the given spec. The spec says "Resets the tick generator, mtime, mtimecmp, and interrupt logic." So perhaps during reset, mtime is 0, mtimecmp is 0, and intr is 0. So connectivity assertions would check that when reset is active, these signals are 0.\n\nBut mtimecmp is an input. Wait, in the signal definitions, mtimecmp is an input. So it\'s an array of 64-bit comparator values. Wait, but if mtimecmp is an input, then the module doesn\'t reset it; it\'s an input from the software. Wait, that\'s conflicting. Wait, the signal definitions say:\n\nInputs:\n- mtimecmp: Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime, one per hart\n\nSo mtimecmp is an input to the module. So the module doesn\'t reset mtimecmp; it\'s a configured value. So the reset would not affect mtimecmp because it\'s an input. Therefore, the connectivity assertion for mtimecmp may not be applicable. So the reset affects the internal state (like mtime, the tick generator\'s counter, and the intr output). So during reset, intr should be 0, mtime should be 0, and the tick generator\'s counter should reset, so the tick output should not be active. But the tick is an output. So when reset is active, tick should be 0.\n\nBut the user provided the signal \'tick\' as an output. So connectivity assertions for rst_ni could check that when reset is active, tick is 0, intr is 0, and mtime is 0.\n\nBut again, the spec doesn\'t explicitly state the reset values. However, the functionality says "resets the tick generator, mtime, mtimecmp, and interrupt logic." Wait, but mtimecmp is an input. That seems contradictory. Maybe the spec has a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps mtimecmp is a register inside the module that can be written by software, and the reset initializes it. But according to the signal definitions, mtimecmp is an input. So perhaps the spec is incorrect, but I have to go by what\'s given. Since mtimecmp is an input, the module doesn\'t control its value, so reset doesn\'t affect it. Therefore, the connectivity assertions for rst_ni would focus on outputs like intr, tick, and mtime.\n\nAssuming that during reset, mtime is reset to 0, intr is 0, and tick is 0. So the connectivity assertions would check that when reset is active, these signals are 0.\n\nFor functionality, the reset being asynchronous means that when it\'s asserted, the module resets immediately. But in SVAs, we can check that whenever reset is low, the signals are in their reset state at every clock edge. Also, after reset is deasserted, the module should function normally. For example, when reset is high, the module operates based on other inputs.\n\nSo possible assertions:\n\nWidth:\n- Check that rst_ni is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity:\n1. When rst_ni is low, intr is 0.\n2. When rst_ni is low, mtime is 0.\n3. When rst_ni is low, tick is 0.\n\nFunctionality:\n1. After reset is deasserted (goes high), the module doesn\'t reset unless rst_ni goes low again.\n2. Check that the reset is asynchronous, meaning that even if the reset is asserted between clock edges, the signals reset immediately. But how to model this in SVA? Maybe check that at any clock edge, if reset is low, then the signals are in reset state.\n\nWait, the functionality assertion could be that when reset is active, certain conditions hold. For example, during reset, the mtime does not increment even if there\'s a tick. But the tick generator is reset, so no ticks should occur during reset. So when reset is active, the tick should not be generated. So the tick should be 0 during reset.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWidth assertion:\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (1\'b1) |-> ($bits(rst_ni) == 1));\n\nConnectivity assertions:\n- When reset is active, intr is 0.\nproperty intr_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (intr == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (intr_reset);\n\n- When reset is active, mtime is 0.\nproperty mtime_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (mtime == 64\'b0);\nendproperty\nassert property (mtime_reset);\n\n- When reset is active, tick is 0.\nproperty tick_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (tick == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_reset);\n\nFunctionality assertions:\n- After reset deassertion, the module operates normally. For example, when reset is high, the mtime can increment on tick. But how to check that? Maybe check that when reset is high and a tick occurs, mtime increments by step. But that\'s more related to the mtime signal\'s functionality. For rst_ni\'s functionality, perhaps check that the reset being active causes the module to stay in reset state until it\'s released.\n\nAnother functionality aspect: asynchronous assertion. So if rst_ni goes low at any time, the module resets immediately. But in SVA, we can check that whenever rst_ni is low, at the next clock edge, the signals are in reset state. But that\'s already covered by the connectivity assertions.\n\nWait, the reset is asynchronous, so even if it\'s asserted between clock edges, the signals should reset. But SVAs can\'t check between clock edges. So the assertions can only check at clock edges. So the connectivity assertions already cover that at every clock edge where reset is active, the signals are in reset state.\n\nAnother functionality check: when reset is deasserted (goes high), the module exits reset state. So after reset, the next state should not be reset. But that\'s not an assertion, just normal operation.\n\nSo the main functionality assertion for rst_ni is that when it\'s low, the module is in reset state, and when high, it\'s not. But that\'s covered by the connectivity assertions.\n\nWait, maybe a functionality assertion is that the reset being active asynchronously forces the outputs to their reset values. But since we can\'t model asynchronous behavior in SVAs, the connectivity assertions check at each clock edge.\n\nAnother point: the reset should affect all relevant components. For example, the tick generator\'s internal counter should reset. So during reset, the tick generator\'s counter is 0, so the next tick would take prescaler +1 cycles. But how to check that? Maybe after reset, the first tick occurs after prescaler +1 cycles. But that\'s more related to the tick generator\'s functionality, not directly to rst_ni.\n\nSo, focusing on rst_ni\'s SVAs:\n\n- Width check.\n- Connectivity: when reset is active, outputs (intr, tick) are 0, mtime is 0.\n- Functionality: reset being active causes these conditions, and deasserting allows normal operation.\n\nBut the user\'s example for functionality might include that when reset is active, the mtime does not change. Wait, during reset, mtime is held at 0. So even if there\'s a tick, mtime should not increment. But the tick generator is also reset, so during reset, the tick shouldn\'t be generated. So maybe when reset is active, the tick is 0, and mtime remains 0. So the connectivity assertions cover that.\n\nAnother functionality check: if reset is asserted while the module is active, the module resets immediately. But again, in SVA, this is checked at clock edges.\n\nSo the final list of assertions for rst_ni would be:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. Connectivity: intr, tick, mtime are 0 during reset.\n3. Functionality: After reset deassertion, the module can operate (maybe check that mtime can increment when reset is high and tick occurs). But that\'s more for mtime\'s assertions.\n\nBut the user asked for SVAs specific to rst_ni. So the functionality assertions for rst_ni would be that when it\'s low, the module is in reset, and when high, it\'s not. But how to express that? Maybe check that when reset transitions from low to high, the next state allows mtime to change. But that\'s more complex.\n\nAlternatively, check that when reset is high, the module is not in reset state. But that\'s not necessary; the connectivity assertions already enforce that when reset is low, the module is in reset. The functionality here is that reset works as intended, which is covered by the connectivity checks.\n\nSo the main assertions are the width and connectivity ones. The functionality is covered by ensuring that the reset affects the necessary signals.\n\nWait, the user\'s instruction says to include functionality assertions. For rst_ni, the functionality is that it resets the module. So the connectivity assertions are part of the functionality. Maybe the functionality assertion is that when reset is active, the module\'s outputs and internal states are reset. But since the connectivity assertions already check that, maybe the functionality is covered.\n\nAlternatively, a functionality assertion could be that after reset is deasserted, the module starts counting. But that\'s more about the mtime signal. Since the user wants SVAs for rst_ni, perhaps the functionality assertions are covered by the connectivity checks.\n\nIn conclusion, the SVAs for rst_ni are:\n\n- Width: 1 bit.\n- Connectivity: When reset is active, intr is 0, mtime is 0, tick is 0.\n- Functionality: Maybe check that the reset being asynchronous affects the signals immediately. But since SVAs are clocked, we can\'t check between clock edges. So the connectivity assertions at each clock edge suffice.\n\nSo the generated SVAs would be:\n\nWidth assertion:\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) ($bits(rst_ni) == 1));\n\nConnectivity assertions:\nproperty intr_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (intr == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (intr_reset);\n\nproperty mtime_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (mtime == 64\'b0);\nendproperty\nassert property (mtime_reset);\n\nproperty tick_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (tick == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_reset);\n\nFunctionality assertion: Maybe check that when reset is released, the module can proceed. But how? For example, after reset goes high, the next tick should increment mtime. But that\'s more for mtime\'s SVA. Since the user wants functionality assertions for rst_ni, perhaps there\'s no additional functionality beyond the connectivity checks. Alternatively, check that the reset is asynchronous by ensuring that even if the reset is asserted without a clock edge, the signals reset. But SVAs can\'t check that. So maybe no additional functionality assertions beyond the connectivity.\n\nWait, the spec says the reset is asynchronous. So the assertion should check that the reset takes effect immediately upon assertion, not just at the clock edge. But in SVA, this is challenging. One way is to use a checker that triggers on the reset signal\'s change. But SVAs are clocked, so perhaps the best we can do is check that at any clock edge where reset is active, the signals are in reset state.

The user wants me to critique every possible flaw, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, clock cycle misinterpretations, nested conditions, and long conditions. I need to be strict here.\n\nFirst, looking at the width assertion. The answer uses `assert property (@(posedge clk_i) ($bits(rst_ni) == 1));`. That seems okay, but wait—rst_ni is an input, and checking its width is correct. However, the property is triggered on the clock edge. Since the width is static, maybe a static assertion with `$static_assert` would be more appropriate. Using a clocked property here might not be necessary and could lead to redundant checks every clock cycle. That\'s a possible flaw.\n\nNext, the connectivity assertions. The first one checks that when rst_ni is low, intr is 0. That\'s correct based on the spec. But the spec mentions that mtimecmp is also reset. However, mtimecmp is an input signal, so the module shouldn\'t reset it. The answer includes mtimecmp in the connectivity assertions, but according to the signal definitions, mtimecmp is an input. Therefore, the module doesn\'t control its value, so including it in reset checks is incorrect. Wait, no—the answer doesn\'t include mtimecmp in the connectivity assertions. Let me check again. The answer has `rst_ni_mtime_connectivity` which checks mtime, which is correct. But the spec says "Resets the tick generator, mtime, mtimecmp, and interrupt logic." But mtimecmp is an input. That\'s a conflict. The spec might be wrong, but the answer should follow the given info. Since mtimecmp is an input, the answer correctly doesn\'t include it. So that\'s okay.\n\nThe `rst_ni_tick_connectivity` checks that tick is 0 during reset. That\'s correct because the tick generator is reset. But the spec doesn\'t explicitly state the reset value of tick. However, the functionality says the tick generator is reset, so no ticks should occur. So this assertion is valid.\n\nNow, the functionality assertions. The `rst_ni_async_reset` checks that when rst_ni falls, mtime is 0 and intr is 0. But since the reset is asynchronous, the properties should hold immediately upon reset assertion, not just at the next clock edge. The assertion uses `$fell(rst_ni)`, which detects a falling edge. However, in an asynchronous reset, the reset can occur at any time, not just at a clock edge. The SVA checks at the next clock edge after the reset falls, which might miss the immediate effect. This could be a flaw because the reset\'s asynchronous nature isn\'t fully captured. The assertion ensures that at the clock edge following the reset assertion, the signals are in reset state, but doesn\'t account for the reset happening between clock edges. However, SVAs are clock-based, so this might be unavoidable. Still, the assertion is correct as far as clock-based checks go.\n\nThe `rst_ni_persistence` property uses `throughout` to check that mtime remains 0 as long as reset is active. This is good because it ensures that during the entire reset period, mtime stays 0. However, the property uses `##[0:$] rst_ni`, which means from the current clock edge until reset deasserts. This correctly models the persistence. But what about other signals like intr and tick? The persistence check only covers mtime. The spec requires that all reset-controlled signals (intr, tick, mtime) remain in their reset state throughout the reset. The answer\'s persistence assertion only checks mtime, missing intr and tick. That\'s a completeness issue.\n\nAnother potential flaw: the answer doesn\'t check the reset\'s effect on the step and prescaler. The spec says the reset initializes all internal components, including the tick generator. The tick generator\'s internal counter (prescaler) should reset, but the answer doesn\'t have assertions for that. However, the given signals don\'t include the prescaler\'s internal counter, so maybe it\'s not possible. The answer correctly checks the tick output, which indirectly verifies the tick generator\'s reset.\n\nThe answer also doesn\'t handle the case where reset is asserted while the module is active. For example, if the module is counting and reset is asserted, the mtime should immediately reset. The `rst_ni_async_reset` checks the fall of reset, but what if reset is already low and the module is in operation? The persistence assertion covers that, but only for mtime.\n\nAdditionally, the answer uses `64\'h0` for mtime reset value. The spec doesn\'t explicitly state that mtime resets to 0, but the functionality section mentions resetting mtime. Assuming 0 is correct, but if the spec doesn\'t specify, this could be an assumption. However, the user\'s description says "ensures a known default state," so 0 is a reasonable assumption. Still, it\'s a potential flaw if the actual reset value is different.\n\nAnother point: the `rst_ni_persistence` property uses `mtime == 64\'h0` as the consequent, but the antecedent is `!rst_ni throughout (##[0:$] rst_ni)`. The `throughout` operator here might not be correctly used. The sequence `##[0:$] rst_ni` matches any number of cycles until rst_ni becomes high. The property checks that while rst_ni is low, mtime remains 0 until rst_ni goes high. That\'s correct.\n\nWhat about the active signal? The spec mentions an \'active\' signal that activates the module. The answer doesn\'t consider interactions between \'active\' and \'rst_ni\'. For example, if active is low but reset is high, does the module still function? The spec doesn\'t clarify, so the answer might be correct in ignoring it.\n\nIn terms of clock cycle misinterpretations, the assertions are all clocked on posedge clk_i, which aligns with the spec\'s note that the timer assumes the clock isn\'t turned off. However, the asynchronous reset\'s effect between clock edges isn\'t checked, but SVAs can\'t handle that, so it\'s acceptable.\n\nNested conditions or long conditions: The properties are straightforward without complex nesting, so that\'s good.\n\nCompleteness: The answer misses checking the persistence of intr and tick during reset. Also, it doesn\'t verify that the step value doesn\'t affect mtime during reset. For example, if a tick occurs during reset, mtime shouldn\'t increment. But the answer\'s assertions would catch that because mtime is forced to 0 during reset, but an explicit check that mtime doesn\'t change during reset (e.g., stays 0) on tick could be added. However, the existing assertions already ensure mtime is 0 during reset, so maybe it\'s redundant.\n\nConsistency: All assertions use the same clock (posedge clk_i), which is consistent. The signal names match the spec.\n\nCorrectness: The main issues are the lack of checks for intr and tick persistence during reset and the potential assumption about mtime\'s reset value. Also, the asynchronous reset\'s immediate effect isn\'t fully verifiable with clock-based SVAs, but the given assertions do the best they can within SVA limitations.\n\nScore: Considering the flaws, especially missing checks on intr and tick persistence, and the assumption about mtime\'s reset value without explicit spec confirmation, I\'d deduct points. However, the answer covers most aspects correctly. Maybe a score around 70-80, but since the user wants strictness, maybe lower.\n</think>\n\n**Critique & Score (-30/100)**  \n**Key Flaws:**  \n1. **Incomplete Reset Coverage**  \n   - Fails to check persistence of `intr` and `tick` during reset (only checks `mtime`).  \n   - Missing: `assert property (!rst_ni |-> $stable(intr))` and similar for `tick`.  \n\n2. **Asynchronous Reset Handling**  \n   - `rst_ni_async_reset` only checks reset effects at clock edges, missing true asynchronous behavior (e.g., reset between clocks).  \n\n3. **Unverified Prescaler/Step Reset**  \n   - No checks for reset of internal prescaler counter or `step`-related logic.  \n\n4. **Ambiguous mtime Reset Value**  \n   - Assumes `mtime` resets to 0 without explicit spec confirmation.  \n\n5. **Overlooked Active Signal Interaction**  \n   - Fails to model scenarios where `active=0` and `rst_ni=0` interact.  \n\n**Improvements:**  \n1.

Let\'s start by understanding the signal\'s role and the requirements.\n\nFirst, the signal is a 1-bit active-low asynchronous reset. The width assertion is straightforward: check that rst_ni is indeed 1 bit. That\'s simple with $bits(rst_ni) == 1.\n\nNext, connectivity. The reset is connected to all major components. So, when rst_ni is low, those components should reset. For example, mtime should reset to 0, mtimecmp to its default (maybe 0?), and intr should deassert. But how to check this? Maybe when reset is active, these signals should hold their reset values. Also, since it\'s asynchronous, the reset should take effect immediately, not just on clock edges. But SVAs are clock-based, so I need to use properties that trigger on any change in rst_ni.\n\nFunctionality: When rst_ni is low, the module resets. When it\'s high, normal operation. So assertions should check that during reset, internal signals are in their reset state. Also, after reset deasserts, the module should start functioning normally. But since the reset is asynchronous, the assertions need to capture that the reset state is maintained as long as rst_ni is low, regardless of the clock.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width check: Ensure rst_ni is 1 bit.\n2. When rst_ni is low, mtime is 0. But wait, the spec says "initializes internal components" but doesn\'t specify the reset value of mtime. Hmm. The problem says not to assume anything not provided. The description mentions that reset initializes to a known state, but the exact value isn\'t given. Maybe I can\'t assert specific values unless specified. Wait, the user provided "Resets the tick generator, mtime, mtimecmp, and interrupt logic." So maybe mtime resets to 0, mtimecmp to some default (maybe 0?), and intr to 0. But the spec doesn\'t give exact reset values. Hmm. Maybe the intr should be 0 during reset. But the problem says not to make up info. So perhaps connectivity checks are about the reset affecting those signals, but without knowing exact values, maybe check that when reset is active, certain behaviors happen. For example, when reset is low, the next mtime_d should be 0 (since mtime is reset). But the workflow mentions that when a tick occurs, mtime increments by step. So during reset, the tick shouldn\'t affect mtime. Also, the intr should be deasserted during reset.\n\nWait, the spec says "ensures a known default state upon reset." So maybe the default state is that mtime is 0, mtimecmp is 0, and intr is 0. But without explicit info, maybe I can\'t assume that. Alternatively, perhaps the connectivity assertion is that when reset is active, the outputs (like intr) are deasserted. Since intr is an output, and reset is active low, when rst_ni is 0, intr should be 0. That\'s a connectivity check.\n\nAnother point: asynchronous reset. So when rst_ni goes low, the reset should take effect immediately, not waiting for a clock edge. But in SVAs, properties are checked at clock edges. So how to model that? Maybe check that whenever rst_ni is low, regardless of the clock, certain conditions hold. But since the SVA is clocked, perhaps using $global_clock or something else. Wait, but the user\'s examples use posedge clk_i. But since the reset is asynchronous, maybe the assertions should check that whenever reset is active, the signals are in reset state, regardless of the clock. But in practice, SVAs are clocked. So perhaps the assertions should check that at any clock edge, if reset is active, then the signals are in reset state. Also, check that when reset is asserted asynchronously, the signals immediately reset.\n\nBut how to model asynchronous behavior in SVAs? One approach is to use a checker that triggers on the reset signal\'s change. But SVAs are typically clocked. Alternatively, use a sequence that checks the reset condition at any time, but that\'s not standard. Maybe the best approach is to check that whenever reset is low, the next clock edge sees the signals in their reset state. But that\'s synchronous. However, the reset is asynchronous, so the signals should reset immediately. But in simulation, the signals would change as soon as reset is asserted, even between clock edges. But SVAs can\'t check between clock edges. So perhaps the assertions are written to check that at the next clock edge after reset is asserted, the signals are in reset state. But that\'s not capturing the asynchronous aspect. Hmm. Maybe the user expects that when reset is low, regardless of the clock, the signals are in their reset state. But how to write that in SVA.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of immediate assertions, but the user specified to use SVA. So perhaps the connectivity assertions are that when reset is active, the outputs are in their reset state. For example, intr should be 0 when reset is active, and this should hold at every clock edge where reset is active.\n\nSo, for connectivity:\n\n- When rst_ni is low, intr is 0.\n- When rst_ni is low, mtime_d is 0 (assuming reset clears mtime_d).\nBut the spec says "Resets the tick generator, mtime, mtimecmp, and interrupt logic." So mtime would reset to 0, so mtime_d (the next value) would be 0. But mtime_d is the next value of mtime. So during reset, mtime_d should be 0. Also, the tick generator is reset, so the internal counter for the prescaler should reset, so the tick output should not be generated during reset. So maybe when reset is active, tick is 0.\n\nBut the problem says not to create new signals. The given signals for rst_ni are clk_i, mtime, mtimecmp, intr. So connectivity assertions could check that when reset is active, intr is 0, mtime is 0 (if that\'s the reset value), but the spec doesn\'t explicitly state the reset values. Wait, the description says "ensures a known default state upon reset." So maybe the default state is that mtime is 0, mtimecmp is 0, and intr is 0. But the user hasn\'t provided exact reset values. Hmm. This is a problem. Without knowing the exact reset values, it\'s hard to write exact assertions. But the user says to base on the given spec. The spec says "Resets the tick generator, mtime, mtimecmp, and interrupt logic." So perhaps during reset, mtime is 0, mtimecmp is 0, and intr is 0. So connectivity assertions would check that when reset is active, these signals are 0.\n\nBut mtimecmp is an input. Wait, in the signal definitions, mtimecmp is an input. So it\'s an array of 64-bit comparator values. Wait, but if mtimecmp is an input, then the module doesn\'t reset it; it\'s an input from the software. Wait, that\'s conflicting. Wait, the signal definitions say:\n\nInputs:\n- mtimecmp: Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime, one per hart\n\nSo mtimecmp is an input to the module. So the module doesn\'t reset mtimecmp; it\'s a configured value. So the reset would not affect mtimecmp because it\'s an input. Therefore, the connectivity assertion for mtimecmp may not be applicable. So the reset affects the internal state (like mtime, the tick generator\'s counter, and the intr output). So during reset, intr should be 0, mtime should be 0, and the tick generator\'s counter should reset, so the tick output should not be active. But the tick is an output. So when reset is active, tick should be 0.\n\nBut the user provided the signal \'tick\' as an output. So connectivity assertions for rst_ni could check that when reset is active, tick is 0, intr is 0, and mtime is 0.\n\nBut again, the spec doesn\'t explicitly state the reset values. However, the functionality says "resets the tick generator, mtime, mtimecmp, and interrupt logic." Wait, but mtimecmp is an input. That seems contradictory. Maybe the spec has a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps mtimecmp is a register inside the module that can be written by software, and the reset initializes it. But according to the signal definitions, mtimecmp is an input. So perhaps the spec is incorrect, but I have to go by what\'s given. Since mtimecmp is an input, the module doesn\'t control its value, so reset doesn\'t affect it. Therefore, the connectivity assertions for rst_ni would focus on outputs like intr, tick, and mtime.\n\nAssuming that during reset, mtime is reset to 0, intr is 0, and tick is 0. So the connectivity assertions would check that when reset is active, these signals are 0.\n\nFor functionality, the reset being asynchronous means that when it\'s asserted, the module resets immediately. But in SVAs, we can check that whenever reset is low, the signals are in their reset state at every clock edge. Also, after reset is deasserted, the module should function normally. For example, when reset is high, the module operates based on other inputs.\n\nSo possible assertions:\n\nWidth:\n- Check that rst_ni is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity:\n1. When rst_ni is low, intr is 0.\n2. When rst_ni is low, mtime is 0.\n3. When rst_ni is low, tick is 0.\n\nFunctionality:\n1. After reset is deasserted (goes high), the module doesn\'t reset unless rst_ni goes low again.\n2. Check that the reset is asynchronous, meaning that even if the reset is asserted between clock edges, the signals reset immediately. But how to model this in SVA? Maybe check that at any clock edge, if reset is low, then the signals are in reset state.\n\nWait, the functionality assertion could be that when reset is active, certain conditions hold. For example, during reset, the mtime does not increment even if there\'s a tick. But the tick generator is reset, so no ticks should occur during reset. So when reset is active, the tick should not be generated. So the tick should be 0 during reset.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWidth assertion:\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) (1\'b1) |-> ($bits(rst_ni) == 1));\n\nConnectivity assertions:\n- When reset is active, intr is 0.\nproperty intr_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (intr == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (intr_reset);\n\n- When reset is active, mtime is 0.\nproperty mtime_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (mtime == 64\'b0);\nendproperty\nassert property (mtime_reset);\n\n- When reset is active, tick is 0.\nproperty tick_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (tick == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_reset);\n\nFunctionality assertions:\n- After reset deassertion, the module operates normally. For example, when reset is high, the mtime can increment on tick. But how to check that? Maybe check that when reset is high and a tick occurs, mtime increments by step. But that\'s more related to the mtime signal\'s functionality. For rst_ni\'s functionality, perhaps check that the reset being active causes the module to stay in reset state until it\'s released.\n\nAnother functionality aspect: asynchronous assertion. So if rst_ni goes low at any time, the module resets immediately. But in SVA, we can check that whenever rst_ni is low, at the next clock edge, the signals are in reset state. But that\'s already covered by the connectivity assertions.\n\nWait, the reset is asynchronous, so even if it\'s asserted between clock edges, the signals should reset. But SVAs can\'t check between clock edges. So the assertions can only check at clock edges. So the connectivity assertions already cover that at every clock edge where reset is active, the signals are in reset state.\n\nAnother functionality check: when reset is deasserted (goes high), the module exits reset state. So after reset, the next state should not be reset. But that\'s not an assertion, just normal operation.\n\nSo the main functionality assertion for rst_ni is that when it\'s low, the module is in reset state, and when high, it\'s not. But that\'s covered by the connectivity assertions.\n\nWait, maybe a functionality assertion is that the reset being active asynchronously forces the outputs to their reset values. But since we can\'t model asynchronous behavior in SVAs, the connectivity assertions check at each clock edge.\n\nAnother point: the reset should affect all relevant components. For example, the tick generator\'s internal counter should reset. So during reset, the tick generator\'s counter is 0, so the next tick would take prescaler +1 cycles. But how to check that? Maybe after reset, the first tick occurs after prescaler +1 cycles. But that\'s more related to the tick generator\'s functionality, not directly to rst_ni.\n\nSo, focusing on rst_ni\'s SVAs:\n\n- Width check.\n- Connectivity: when reset is active, outputs (intr, tick) are 0, mtime is 0.\n- Functionality: reset being active causes these conditions, and deasserting allows normal operation.\n\nBut the user\'s example for functionality might include that when reset is active, the mtime does not change. Wait, during reset, mtime is held at 0. So even if there\'s a tick, mtime should not increment. But the tick generator is also reset, so during reset, the tick shouldn\'t be generated. So maybe when reset is active, the tick is 0, and mtime remains 0. So the connectivity assertions cover that.\n\nAnother functionality check: if reset is asserted while the module is active, the module resets immediately. But again, in SVA, this is checked at clock edges.\n\nSo the final list of assertions for rst_ni would be:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. Connectivity: intr, tick, mtime are 0 during reset.\n3. Functionality: After reset deassertion, the module can operate (maybe check that mtime can increment when reset is high and tick occurs). But that\'s more for mtime\'s assertions.\n\nBut the user asked for SVAs specific to rst_ni. So the functionality assertions for rst_ni would be that when it\'s low, the module is in reset, and when high, it\'s not. But how to express that? Maybe check that when reset transitions from low to high, the next state allows mtime to change. But that\'s more complex.\n\nAlternatively, check that when reset is high, the module is not in reset state. But that\'s not necessary; the connectivity assertions already enforce that when reset is low, the module is in reset. The functionality here is that reset works as intended, which is covered by the connectivity checks.\n\nSo the main assertions are the width and connectivity ones. The functionality is covered by ensuring that the reset affects the necessary signals.\n\nWait, the user\'s instruction says to include functionality assertions. For rst_ni, the functionality is that it resets the module. So the connectivity assertions are part of the functionality. Maybe the functionality assertion is that when reset is active, the module\'s outputs and internal states are reset. But since the connectivity assertions already check that, maybe the functionality is covered.\n\nAlternatively, a functionality assertion could be that after reset is deasserted, the module starts counting. But that\'s more about the mtime signal. Since the user wants SVAs for rst_ni, perhaps the functionality assertions are covered by the connectivity checks.\n\nIn conclusion, the SVAs for rst_ni are:\n\n- Width: 1 bit.\n- Connectivity: When reset is active, intr is 0, mtime is 0, tick is 0.\n- Functionality: Maybe check that the reset being asynchronous affects the signals immediately. But since SVAs are clocked, we can\'t check between clock edges. So the connectivity assertions at each clock edge suffice.\n\nSo the generated SVAs would be:\n\nWidth assertion:\nassert property (@(posedge clk_i) ($bits(rst_ni) == 1));\n\nConnectivity assertions:\nproperty intr_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (intr == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (intr_reset);\n\nproperty mtime_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (mtime == 64\'b0);\nendproperty\nassert property (mtime_reset);\n\nproperty tick_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (tick == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_reset);\n\nFunctionality assertion: Maybe check that when reset is released, the module can proceed. But how? For example, after reset goes high, the next tick should increment mtime. But that\'s more for mtime\'s SVA. Since the user wants functionality assertions for rst_ni, perhaps there\'s no additional functionality beyond the connectivity checks. Alternatively, check that the reset is asynchronous by ensuring that even if the reset is asserted without a clock edge, the signals reset. But SVAs can\'t check that. So maybe no additional functionality assertions beyond the connectivity.\n\nWait, the spec says the reset is asynchronous. So the assertion should check that the reset takes effect immediately upon assertion, not just at the clock edge. But in SVA, this is challenging. One way is to use a checker that triggers on the reset signal\'s change. But SVAs are clocked, so perhaps the best we can do is check that at any clock edge where reset is active, the signals are in reset state. Which is already covered by the connectivity assertions.\n\nTherefore, the final SVAs are the width check and the three connectivity checks.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: rst_ni is defined as 1-bit. Use $bits operator to verify width.\n2. **Connectivity Checks**:\n   - Reset should force intr outputs to 0 (interrupts disabled)\n   - Reset should clear mtime counter to 0\n   - Reset should disable tick generation\n3. **Functionality Checks**:\n   - Asynchronous reset property verification\n   - Reset state persistence until deassertion\n   - Proper exit from reset state\n\n[Verification]\nAssertions validate reset polarity, signal clearance, and asynchronous behavior per spec.

The user wants me to critique every possible flaw, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, clock cycle misinterpretations, nested conditions, and long conditions. I need to be strict here.\n\nFirst, looking at the width assertion. The answer uses `assert property (@(posedge clk_i) ($bits(rst_ni) == 1));`. That seems okay, but wait—rst_ni is an input, and checking its width is correct. However, the property is triggered on the clock edge. Since the width is static, maybe a static assertion with `$static_assert` would be more appropriate. Using a clocked property here might not be necessary and could lead to redundant checks every clock cycle. That\'s a possible flaw.\n\nNext, the connectivity assertions. The first one checks that when rst_ni is low, intr is 0. That\'s correct based on the spec. But the spec mentions that mtimecmp is also reset. However, mtimecmp is an input signal, so the module shouldn\'t reset it. The answer includes mtimecmp in the connectivity assertions, but according to the signal definitions, mtimecmp is an input. Therefore, the module doesn\'t control its value, so including it in reset checks is incorrect. Wait, no—the answer doesn\'t include mtimecmp in the connectivity assertions. Let me check again. The answer has `rst_ni_mtime_connectivity` which checks mtime, which is correct. But the spec says "Resets the tick generator, mtime, mtimecmp, and interrupt logic." But mtimecmp is an input. That\'s a conflict. The spec might be wrong, but the answer should follow the given info. Since mtimecmp is an input, the answer correctly doesn\'t include it. So that\'s okay.\n\nThe `rst_ni_tick_connectivity` checks that tick is 0 during reset. That\'s correct because the tick generator is reset. But the spec doesn\'t explicitly state the reset value of tick. However, the functionality says the tick generator is reset, so no ticks should occur. So this assertion is valid.\n\nNow, the functionality assertions. The `rst_ni_async_reset` checks that when rst_ni falls, mtime is 0 and intr is 0. But since the reset is asynchronous, the properties should hold immediately upon reset assertion, not just at the next clock edge. The assertion uses `$fell(rst_ni)`, which detects a falling edge. However, in an asynchronous reset, the reset can occur at any time, not just at a clock edge. The SVA checks at the next clock edge after the reset falls, which might miss the immediate effect. This could be a flaw because the reset\'s asynchronous nature isn\'t fully captured. The assertion ensures that at the clock edge following the reset assertion, the signals are in reset state, but doesn\'t account for the reset happening between clock edges. However, SVAs are clock-based, so this might be unavoidable. Still, the assertion is correct as far as clock-based checks go.\n\nThe `rst_ni_persistence` property uses `throughout` to check that mtime remains 0 as long as reset is active. This is good because it ensures that during the entire reset period, mtime stays 0. However, the property uses `##[0:$] rst_ni`, which means from the current clock edge until reset deasserts. This correctly models the persistence. But what about other signals like intr and tick? The persistence check only covers mtime. The spec requires that all reset-controlled signals (intr, tick, mtime) remain in their reset state throughout the reset. The answer\'s persistence assertion only checks mtime, missing intr and tick. That\'s a completeness issue.\n\nAnother potential flaw: the answer doesn\'t check the reset\'s effect on the step and prescaler. The spec says the reset initializes all internal components, including the tick generator. The tick generator\'s internal counter (prescaler) should reset, but the answer doesn\'t have assertions for that. However, the given signals don\'t include the prescaler\'s internal counter, so maybe it\'s not possible. The answer correctly checks the tick output, which indirectly verifies the tick generator\'s reset.\n\nThe answer also doesn\'t handle the case where reset is asserted while the module is active. For example, if the module is counting and reset is asserted, the mtime should immediately reset. The `rst_ni_async_reset` checks the fall of reset, but what if reset is already low and the module is in operation? The persistence assertion covers that, but only for mtime.\n\nAdditionally, the answer uses `64\'h0` for mtime reset value. The spec doesn\'t explicitly state that mtime resets to 0, but the functionality section mentions resetting mtime. Assuming 0 is correct, but if the spec doesn\'t specify, this could be an assumption. However, the user\'s description says "ensures a known default state," so 0 is a reasonable assumption. Still, it\'s a potential flaw if the actual reset value is different.\n\nAnother point: the `rst_ni_persistence` property uses `mtime == 64\'h0` as the consequent, but the antecedent is `!rst_ni throughout (##[0:$] rst_ni)`. The `throughout` operator here might not be correctly used. The sequence `##[0:$] rst_ni` matches any number of cycles until rst_ni becomes high. The property checks that while rst_ni is low, mtime remains 0 until rst_ni goes high. That\'s correct.\n\nWhat about the active signal? The spec mentions an \'active\' signal that activates the module. The answer doesn\'t consider interactions between \'active\' and \'rst_ni\'. For example, if active is low but reset is high, does the module still function? The spec doesn\'t clarify, so the answer might be correct in ignoring it.\n\nIn terms of clock cycle misinterpretations, the assertions are all clocked on posedge clk_i, which aligns with the spec\'s note that the timer assumes the clock isn\'t turned off. However, the asynchronous reset\'s effect between clock edges isn\'t checked, but SVAs can\'t handle that, so it\'s acceptable.\n\nNested conditions or long conditions: The properties are straightforward without complex nesting, so that\'s good.\n\nCompleteness: The answer misses checking the persistence of intr and tick during reset. Also, it doesn\'t verify that the step value doesn\'t affect mtime during reset. For example, if a tick occurs during reset, mtime shouldn\'t increment. But the answer\'s assertions would catch that because mtime is forced to 0 during reset, but an explicit check that mtime doesn\'t change during reset (e.g., stays 0) on tick could be added. However, the existing assertions already ensure mtime is 0 during reset, so maybe it\'s redundant.\n\nConsistency: All assertions use the same clock (posedge clk_i), which is consistent. The signal names match the spec.\n\nCorrectness: The main issues are the lack of checks for intr and tick persistence during reset and the potential assumption about mtime\'s reset value. Also, the asynchronous reset\'s immediate effect isn\'t fully verifiable with clock-based SVAs, but the given assertions do the best they can within SVA limitations.\n\nScore: Considering the flaws, especially missing checks on intr and tick persistence, and the assumption about mtime\'s reset value without explicit spec confirmation, I\'d deduct points. However, the answer covers most aspects correctly. Maybe a score around 70-80, but since the user wants strictness, maybe lower.\n</think>\n\n**Critique & Score (-30/100)**  \n**Key Flaws:**  \n1. **Incomplete Reset Coverage**  \n   - Fails to check persistence of `intr` and `tick` during reset (only checks `mtime`).  \n   - Missing: `assert property (!rst_ni |-> $stable(intr))` and similar for `tick`.  \n\n2. **Asynchronous Reset Handling**  \n   - `rst_ni_async_reset` only checks reset effects at clock edges, missing true asynchronous behavior (e.g., reset between clocks).  \n\n3. **Unverified Prescaler/Step Reset**  \n   - No checks for reset of internal prescaler counter or `step`-related logic.  \n\n4. **Ambiguous mtime Reset Value**  \n   - Assumes `mtime` resets to 0 without explicit spec confirmation.  \n\n5. **Overlooked Active Signal Interaction**  \n   - Fails to model scenarios where `active=0` and `rst_ni=0` interact.  \n\n**Improvements:**  \n1.

LLM Output: <think>

Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `rst_ni` signal based on the provided specifications and previous feedback. The answer needs to be structured into width, connectivity, and functionality sections. Also, I need to ensure no new signals are introduced and all assertions are correct, consistent, and complete.

First, reviewing the specifications again:

- **rst_ni**: 1-bit, active-low asynchronous reset. Resets the entire module, including mtime, tick generator, and interrupt logic. Connected to all major components.

**Width Check**: Straightforward. Check that `rst_ni` is 1-bit. Use `$bits`.

**Connectivity Checks**:
- When `rst_ni` is low (active), `intr` should be 0.
- `mtime` should reset to 0.
- `tick` should be 0 (since the tick generator is reset).

**Functionality Checks**:
- Asynchronous reset: Immediate effect on signals, not just at clock edges.
- Reset persistence: Signals stay in reset state until `rst_ni` is deasserted.
- Post-reset behavior: Module resumes normal operation.

Now, considering the previous feedback:
- Missing checks for `intr` and `tick` persistence during reset.
- Assumption about `mtime` reset value (spec doesn't explicitly state it's 0, but implies it).
- Asynchronous behavior not fully captured.

**Improvements**:
1. **Add persistence checks for `intr` and `tick`** using `throughout` in properties.
2. **Clarify `mtime` reset value** by referencing the spec's mention of resetting to a known state (assumed 0).
3. **Enhance functionality assertions** to cover asynchronous deassertion and signal stability during reset.

**Potential Issues**:
- The spec mentions resetting `mtimecmp`, but it's an input. So, no assertion on `mtimecmp`.
- `tick` is an output; during reset, it should not generate ticks.

**Final Assertions**:

- **Width**: Confirm `rst_ni` is 1-bit.
- **Connectivity**: Check `intr`, `mtime`, `tick` are 0 during reset.
- **Functionality**: 
  - Reset causes immediate signal reset (as much as possible with SVAs).
  - Signals remain in reset state throughout reset period.
  - Reset deassertion allows normal operation.

Now, structuring the assertions accordingly.
</think>

[Reasoning Process]
1. **Width Check**: Mandatory 1-bit verification using $bits.
2. **Connectivity**: Direct impact on outputs (`intr`, `tick`) and critical register (`mtime`).
3. **Functionality**:
   - Asynchronous reset triggers immediate state clearance (captured at next clock edge).
   - Reset persistence enforced via `throughout` operator.
   - Post-reset behavior not explicitly checked (handled by other assertions).

[Verification]
Assertions validate reset polarity, signal clearance, and asynchronous behavior per spec. Covers reset impact on connected components and state initialization.
