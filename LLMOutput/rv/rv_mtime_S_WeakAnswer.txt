This module conforms to\n\nthe Comportable guideline for peripheral functionality. See that document for integration\n\noverview within the broader top level system.\n\nFeatures\n\ne 64-bit timer with 12-bit prescaler and 8-bit step register\ne Compliant with RISC-V privileged specification v1.11\ne Configurable number of timers per hart and number of harts\n\nDescription\n\nThe timer module provides a configurable number of 64-bit counters where each counter\nincrements by a step value whenever the prescaler times out. Each timer generates an\ninterrupt if the counter reaches (or is above) a programmed value. The timer is intended to\nbe used by the processors to check the current time relative to the reset or the system\npower-on.\n\nIn this version, the timer doesnâ€™t consider low-power modes and assumes the clock is\nneither turned off nor changed during runtime.\n\nCompatibility\nThe timer IP provides memory-mapped registers equivalent to mtime and mtimecmp which\ncan be used as the machine-mode timer registers defined in the RISC-V privileged spec.\n\nAdditional features such as prescaler, step, and a configurable number of timers and harts\nhave been added.\n\nTheory of Operation\n\nBlock Diagram\n\nclk_fixed expired\n\ntick[#Harts-1:0]\n\ntick gen :\n\nThe timer module is composed of tick generators, counters, and comparators. A tick\ngenerator creates a tick every time its internal counter hits the CFG@.prescaler value. The\ntick is used to increment mtime by the CFG@.step value. The 64-bit mtime value is\ncompared with the 64-bit mtimecmp. If mtime is greater than or equal to mtimecmp, the\ntimer raises an interrupt.\n\nmtimecmp\nprescaler\n\nDesign Details\n\nTick Generator\n\nThe tick module inside the timer IP is used to generate a fixed period of pulse signal. This\nallows creation of a call-clock timer tick such as 1us or 10us regardless of the system clock\nperiod. It is useful if the system has more than one clock as a clock source. The firmware\njust needs to adjust the CFG@.prescaler value and the actual timer interrupt handling\nroutine does not need a variable clock period to update mt imecmp.\n\nFor instance, if a system switches between 48MHz and 200MHz clocks, a prescaler value of\n47 for 48MHz and 199 for 200MHz will generate a 1us tick. In this version, the timer only\nsupports a single fixed clock, so the firmware should change CFG@.prescaler\nappropriately.\n\nConfigurable number of timers and harts\n\nThe timer IP supports more than one HART and/or more than one timer per hart. Each hart\nhas a set of tick generator and counter. It means the timer IP has the same number of\nprescalers, steps, and mtime registers as the number of harts.\n\nEach hart can have multiple sets of mt imecmp, comparator logic, and expire interrupt\nsignals. This version of the IP is fixed to have one Hart and one Timer per Hart.\n\nHere is the mapping information:\r\n[clk_i]: 1-bit clock input to the tick generator  \r\n[rst_ni]: 1-bit active low reset signal  \r\n[active]: 1-bit module active signal  \r\n[prescaler]: 12-bit prescaler value input for the tick generator  \r\n[step]: 8-bit step value for incrementing mtime  \r\n[mtime]: 64-bit current time value  \r\n[mtimecmp]: Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime, one per hart  \r\n[tick]: 1-bit tick output signal  \r\n[mtime_d]: 64-bit next value of mtime register  \r\n[intr]: N-bit array of interrupt output signals, one per hart  \r\n\r\nHere is the architecture overview:\r\n{\r\n  "TimerModule": {\r\n    "TheoryOfOperation": {\r\n      "BlockDiagram": {\r\n        "Inputs": {\r\n          "clk_i": "Clock input to the tick generator",\r\n          "rst_ni": "Active low reset signal",\r\n          "active": "Module active signal",\r\n          "prescaler": "12-bit prescaler value input for the tick generator",\r\n          "step": "8-bit step value for incrementing mtime",\r\n          "mtime": "64-bit current time value",\r\n          "mtimecmp": "Array of 64-bit comparator values for mtime"\r\n        },\r\n        "Outputs": {\r\n          "tick": "Tick output signal",\r\n          "mtime_d": "64-bit next time value",\r\n          "intr": "Interrupt output signals array"\r\n        },\r\n        "TickGenerator": {\r\n          "Description": "Creates a tick every time its internal counter hits the given prescaler value.

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the mtime signal based on the provided specifications. Let's start by understanding the requirements.

First, the mtime is a 64-bit input signal that holds the current timer value. Its functionality includes being incremented by the step value when a tick occurs, compared to mtimecmp for interrupts, and used by the processor for time measurement. 

The user wants three types of assertions: width, connectivity, and functionality. Let's tackle each type.

Width assertion: The mtime is 64 bits. So, check that its width is always 64 bits. That's straightforward with $bits(mtime) == 64.

Connectivity: Need to ensure mtime is connected properly. Since mtime is an input, maybe check that when active and not in reset, it's updated correctly. Also, mtime_d is the next value. So when a tick occurs, mtime_d should be mtime + step. But wait, the workflow mentions that when a tick is received, the mux selects step or zero. Wait, the step is added when there's a tick. So, when tick is high, mtime_d should be current mtime plus step. If no tick, maybe it stays the same? Or does it increment by zero? The description says "incremented by the step value when a tick is generated." So, only when tick is high, mtime increments by step. Otherwise, it remains. So connectivity assertion would check that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. Also, when not active, maybe mtime doesn't change. But the spec says active is a module active signal. So when active is low, perhaps mtime doesn't update. But the problem says not to create new signals, so maybe check that when active is high, the increment happens. But the user didn't mention active in the related signals for mtime. Wait, the related signals include tick, step, mtimecmp, prescaler, intr. So maybe focus on those.

Functionality: The main function is that mtime increments by step on tick. So, when tick is high, next mtime should be current mtime + step. Also, when mtime >= mtimecmp, the interrupt is raised. But since the current signal is mtime, maybe check that when mtime >= mtimecmp, intr is high. But intr is an output, and mtime is an input. Wait, mtime is an input here. Wait, the signal definitions show mtime as an input. But in the architecture, mtime is part of the TimerModule's inputs. Wait, maybe mtime is a register inside the module, but the signal here is an input. That's confusing. Wait, looking back at the signal definitions:

In the Inputs section, mtime is listed as an input. But in the workflow, mtime is updated by adding step when tick occurs. So perhaps mtime is an internal register, but the signal here is an input. That might be a mistake. Wait, the user provided the signal as an input. But according to the workflow, mtime is incremented by step when tick occurs. So maybe mtime is actually a register that's part of the module, and mtime_d is the next value. But the signal definition says mtime is an input. That's conflicting. Hmm. The user might have made an error here, but I have to go by the given info. 

Wait, the signal definitions under Inputs include mtime as an input. But according to the workflow, mtime is updated by the module. So perhaps there's a confusion here. But the user's specification says mtime is an input. That might be a mistake, but I have to proceed with the given data. Alternatively, maybe mtime is an input that's being updated externally. But that doesn't align with the description. This is a problem. However, the user's instruction says not to create new signals and to use the given ones. So mtime is an input. But according to the workflow, when a tick occurs, mtime is incremented by step. So how is that possible if mtime is an input? Maybe the actual mtime is an internal register, and the input is the current value. But this is unclear. However, given the user's data, I have to proceed.

Assuming that mtime is an input that's supposed to be updated by the module, perhaps via mtime_d. The output mtime_d is the next value. So the connectivity would check that when tick is high, mtime_d equals mtime + step. Also, when tick is low, mtime_d remains the same. But the user's description says mtime is incremented by step when a tick is generated. So the next value of mtime (mtime_d) should be current mtime plus step when tick is active. So the assertion would be: on each clock edge, if tick is high, then mtime_d should be mtime + step. If tick is low, mtime_d remains mtime. But the user's signal list includes mtime as input and mtime_d as output. So mtime_d is the next value. Therefore, the connectivity assertion would check that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. When tick is low, mtime_d remains the same. But the user's description says "incremented by the step value when a tick is generated." So only when tick is high. So the assertion would be: if tick is high, then mtime_d == mtime + step. Also, when not in reset and active is high. Because active is a module enable. So the assertion should consider active and reset.

But the user's instruction says not to create new signals. So active is a signal in the list. So the connectivity assertion should check that when active is high and not in reset, and tick is high, then mtime_d is mtime + step. Also, when active is low, mtime_d remains the same. But how to handle reset? The reset is active low (rst_ni). So when rst_ni is low, the module is in reset, and mtime might be reset to 0. But the user's description doesn't specify reset behavior for mtime. So maybe the reset is handled elsewhere. Since the user didn't mention reset behavior for mtime, perhaps the assertions should not include reset unless specified.

But the functionality says mtime is compared to mtimecmp to trigger interrupts. So another functional assertion would be that when mtime >= mtimecmp, the interrupt (intr) is asserted. But intr is an array, and since the current configuration is one hart and one timer, maybe intr[0] is the relevant signal. But the user's signal list shows intr as N-bit array. So the assertion would check that if mtime >= mtimecmp, then intr is high. But mtimecmp is an array. Since there's one hart, mtimecmp[0] is the comparator. So the assertion would be: mtime >= mtimecmp[0] |-> intr[0]. But the user's description says "each timer generates an interrupt if the counter reaches (or is above) a programmed value." So the functional assertion here is that whenever mtime is >= mtimecmp, the corresponding intr is high. However, the user's signal list shows mtime as input and intr as output. So the assertion would check that when mtime is >= mtimecmp, intr is asserted. But since mtime is an input, maybe this is a concurrent check. However, the intr is generated by the module, so the assertion would check that whenever mtime is >= mtimecmp, intr is high. But this might not be cycle-accurate. For example, if mtime changes, the intr should be updated in the same cycle. But since mtime is an input, perhaps the comparison is combinational. So the assertion would be that whenever mtime >= mtimecmp, intr is high. But the spec says that the timer raises an interrupt if mtime is greater or equal. So the assertion would be: assert property (mtime >= mtimecmp[0] |-> intr[0]). But need to check if the interrupt is level-sensitive or edge-triggered. The spec says "raises an interrupt", which is level-sensitive. So as long as mtime >= mtimecmp, the interrupt is high. So the assertion would check that whenever mtime is >= mtimecmp, intr is high. But since mtime is an input, this is a concurrent condition. However, in the design, the comparison might be registered. But according to the workflow, the expired signal (which drives intr) is generated when mtime >= mtimecmp. So the assertion should check that when mtime >= mtimecmp, intr is high. But need to consider the clock edge. Maybe the comparison is done on the clock edge. So the assertion would check that at each clock edge, if mtime >= mtimecmp, then intr is high. But the spec doesn't mention any latching, so it's possible that the intr is combinational. So the assertion would be:

assert property (@(posedge clk_i) (mtime >= mtimecmp[0]) |-> intr[0]);

But since the number of harts and timers is fixed to one, we can index [0].

Now, putting it all together.

Width assertion: Check that mtime is 64 bits.

Connectivity: When tick is high and active is high and not in reset, mtime_d should be mtime + step. Also, when tick is low, mtime_d remains the same. But how to model that? Maybe two properties: one for when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step, and another for when tick is low, mtime_d remains mtime. But the user's description says mtime is incremented by step when a tick is generated. So only when tick is high. So the connectivity assertion is that when tick is high, mtime_d is mtime + step. But also considering active and reset. The active signal is a module enable. So when active is low, perhaps the mtime doesn't update. But the user's description says "the timer is intended to be used by the processors to check the current time relative to the reset or the system power-on." Also, the active signal is part of the inputs. So the assertion should check that when active is high and not in reset, then on a tick, mtime_d is mtime + step. If active is low, maybe mtime_d doesn't change. But the user's spec doesn't mention the behavior when active is low. So maybe the connectivity assertion should only consider when active is high. So:

property mtime_increment;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)
  (active && tick) |=> (mtime_d == mtime + step);
endproperty
assert property (mtime_increment);

But the '|=>' checks that in the next cycle, mtime_d equals mtime + step. Wait, but in the same cycle, when tick occurs, mtime_d is updated. So perhaps the assertion should be:

At the posedge clk_i, if active is high and tick is high, then mtime_d should be mtime + step. So using overlapping implication (|->):

property mtime_increment;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)
  (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step));
endproperty
assert property (mtime_increment);

Also, when active is high but tick is low, mtime_d should remain the same. So another assertion:

property mtime_no_increment;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)
  (active && !tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime);
endproperty
assert property (mtime_no_increment);

But the user's description says "incremented by the step value when a tick is generated." So when tick is high, increment, else no change. So these two assertions cover connectivity.

Functionality: The interrupt should be asserted when mtime >= mtimecmp. So:

property mtime_interrupt;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)
  (mtime >= mtimecmp[0]) |-> intr[0];
endproperty
assert property (mtime_interrupt);

But need to check if this is a combinational assertion or registered. Since the workflow says the comparator generates expired which drives intr, it's likely combinational. So the assertion is that whenever mtime >= mtimecmp, intr is high. But since it's synchronous to the clock, the check is at each posedge clk_i. So the assertion is correct.

Also, need to check that the step is 8 bits. Wait, the step is an 8-bit input. But in the connectivity assertion, adding mtime (64-bit) and step (8-bit) would require that step is zero-extended or sign-extended. The spec says step is 8-bit, so likely zero-extended to 64 bits. So in the assertion, mtime + step would be mtime + 64'(step). But in SystemVerilog, if you add a 64-bit and 8-bit, it's automatically extended to 64 bits. But to be explicit, maybe cast step to 64 bits. However, the user's code may handle that. The assertion should use mtime + step, assuming that step is properly extended. The spec says step is 8-bit, so the addition would be correct if step is zero-extended. So the assertion is okay.

Now, compiling all these:

Width assertion:

assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(mtime) == 64);

But $bits is a compile-time check, not a dynamic assertion. Wait, $bits returns the bit width of the signal. Since mtime is defined as 64-bit, this assertion is redundant in simulation but can check for correct declaration. However, in SystemVerilog, this is a compile-time check. So perhaps the width assertion is not necessary as a dynamic assertion. But the user requested to include width assertion using $bits. So maybe:

assert property ($bits(mtime) == 64);

But this is a static assertion, not clocked. However, the user's example shows clocked assertions. But the width is static. So perhaps:

// Width check
assert_mtime_width: assert property ($bits(mtime) == 64) else $error("mtime width incorrect");

But the user's example includes clocked assertions, but width is static. So maybe the user expects a static assertion. However, the user's instruction says to use the $bits operator. So the correct way is to have a static assertion.

But in the initial instructions, the user said: "Put the width assertion even if it is 1 bit." So the width assertion is required. So:

assert property ($bits(mtime) == 64);

But in SystemVerilog, this is a compile-time check. However, some tools might allow it as a concurrent assertion. Alternatively, maybe the user expects:

assert property (@(posedge clk_i) 1) else $error("Width check failed"); 

But no, the correct way is to use $bits. So the width assertion is:

assert_mtime_width: assert final ($bits(mtime) == 64);

But 'final' is for immediate assertions. Alternatively, just a static check. However, the user's examples use clocked properties. But since the width is static, perhaps the correct way is to use an immediate assertion:

initial assert ($bits(mtime) == 64) else $error("mtime must be 64 bits");

But the user's instruction says to generate SVAs, which are concurrent assertions. So maybe the user expects a concurrent assertion even though it's static. But that's not technically correct. However, following the user's instruction to include it, even if it's 1 bit, perhaps write:

// Width assertion
assert property (@(posedge clk_i) 1'b1) else $error("mtime width incorrect");
But that doesn't check the width. Alternatively, use $bits in a property:

property width_check;
  int v;
  (1'b1, v = $bits(mtime)) |-> v == 64;
endproperty
assert property (width_check);

But this is more complex. Alternatively, use a sequence:

assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(mtime) == 64);

But $bits is evaluated at compile time, not during simulation. So this assertion would pass/fail during elaboration, not during simulation. Therefore, the correct way is an immediate assertion. But the user's examples show concurrent assertions. To comply with the user's request, perhaps include it as a concurrent assertion even though it's not dynamic. But in practice, this would be an immediate assertion. However, the user might not care as long as the code is syntactically correct. So perhaps write:

// Width check
assert_mtime_width: assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(mtime) == 64);

Even though it's redundant, it's what the user asked for.

Putting it all together:

Width assertion: Check mtime is 64 bits.

Connectivity: Two assertions for when tick is high and low, considering active and reset.

Functionality: Interrupt when mtime >= mtimecmp.

Also, check that mtime_d is correctly updated.

Now, considering the reset. The reset is active low (rst_ni). So disable iff (!rst_ni) would disable the assertion when reset is active.

So the final SVAs would be:

1. Width assertion.
2. Connectivity when tick is high and active, mtime_d is mtime + step.
3. Connectivity when tick is low and active, mtime_d remains mtime.
4. Functionality: mtime >= mtimecmp implies intr.

Also, check that step is 8 bits, but the user didn't ask for step's assertions here. Focus only on mtime.

So the generated SVAs are:

- Width check using $bits.
- Two connectivity assertions for increment and no increment.
- One functionality assertion for interrupt.

Now, code:

// Width assertion
assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(mtime) == 64);

// Connectivity: Increment on tick
property mtime_increment_p;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)
  (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step));
endproperty
assert property (mtime_increment_p);

// Connectivity: No increment when no tick
property mtime_hold_p;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)
  (active && !tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime);
endproperty
assert property (mtime_hold_p);

// Functionality: Interrupt when mtime >= mtimecmp
property mtime_interrupt_p;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)
  (mtime >= mtimecmp[0]) |-> intr[0];
endproperty
assert property (mtime_interrupt_p);

But wait, the mtimecmp is an array. Since the current configuration is one hart and one timer, mtimecmp[0] is used. But if the module is parameterized for multiple harts, the assertion should use a generate loop. However, the user's spec says this version is fixed to one hart and one timer. So indexing [0] is correct.

Also, the step is 8 bits. When added to mtime (64 bits), it should be zero-extended. In SystemVerilog, the addition would automatically handle this, so mtime + step would correctly result in a 64-bit value with step zero-extended.

Another consideration: when the module is not active (active == 0), what happens to mtime_d? The spec says active is a module active signal. So when active is low, perhaps mtime_d doesn't change. But the user's description doesn't specify. However, the connectivity assertions are only checking when active is high. So the assertions are correct as written.

Thus, the final answer includes these four assertions.

[Reasoning Process]
1. **Width Check**: mtime is specified as 64-bit, so verify using $bits.
2. **Connectivity**: 
   - Ensure mtime increments by step when tick occurs (active high, no reset).
   - Check mtime remains unchanged without tick.
3. **Functionality**: 
   - Validate interrupt triggers when mtime >= mtimecmp[0].
   - Compare against mtimecmp and check intr[0] assertion.

[Verification]
- **Width**: Static check for 64-bit width.
- **Increment Logic**: Active high + tick triggers mtime_d = mtime + step.
- **Stability**: No tick means mtime_d remains mtime.
- **Interrupt**: Direct comparison between mtime and mtimecmp[0] drives intr[0].

```systemverilog
// Width assertion
assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(mtime) == 64);

// Connectivity: mtime increments by step on tick (active & !reset)
property mtime_increment_p;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)
  (active && tick) |-> (mtime_d == (mtime + step));
endproperty
assert property (mtime_increment_p);

// Connectivity: mtime holds value when no tick
property mtime_hold_p;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)
  (active && !tick) |-> (mtime_d == mtime);
endproperty
assert property (mtime_hold_p);

// Functionality: Interrupt assertion when mtime >= comparator
property mtime_intr_p;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni)
  (mtime >= mtimecmp[0]) |-> intr[0];
endproperty
assert property (mtime_intr_p);
