Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions related to the signal "tick" from the provided list. First, I need to go through each assertion and check if it's about "tick" and if it's valid according to the documentation.

Starting with the first assertion: 'assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(tick) == 1);'. This checks that the width of the tick signal is 1 bit. The documentation mentions that each hart has its own tick generator, and in the current version, there's one hart and one timer. So the tick signal should be a single bit. This assertion is valid and necessary for ensuring the signal's correct width.

Next, the assertion 'property tick_async_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_async_reset);' checks that when reset is asserted (falling edge of rst_ni), tick is low. The documentation states that during reset or inactive state, the tick should be inactive. This seems valid.

Then we have 'property tick_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !active |-> !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_inactive);'. The active signal isn't mentioned in the docs, but since the timer might have an enable signal, this assertion makes sense to ensure tick is inactive when not active. However, the documentation does mention that the timer isn't considering low-power modes, but the presence of 'active' could be part of the design. So include this.

Looking at the 'tick_periodicity' property. There are two versions. One uses 'last_prescaler' and checks that after a tick, the next tick happens after prescaler +1 cycles. The other uses a counter to check the period. Both are about the periodicity. The documentation mentions that the prescaler generates a tick every prescaler+1 cycles (since it counts from 0). So both assertions might be valid, but perhaps they are duplicates. Need to check if they are unique. The first one uses 'last_prescaler' captured at the rise of tick, then waits for last_prescaler cycles before next tick. The second counts the cycles between ticks. Since they are structured differently, they might both be retained as unique assertions.

The 'tick_single_pulse_dynamic' property ensures that after a tick, it's not high in the next cycle unless prescaler is 0. The docs say that when prescaler is 0, the tick is always high. So this assertion is valid for non-zero prescaler cases.

Another assertion, 'prescaler_max_edge_case', checks that when prescaler is 4095 (12-bit max), the next tick is after 4096 cycles. Since the prescaler is 12-bit, this is a valid edge case check and should be included.

The 'tick_reset_inactive' appears multiple times. Some versions disable iff include !rst_ni || !active and others just check !rst_ni. However, the correct one should ensure that when reset is active (rst_ni low) or when not active, tick is low. Need to check all variations and ensure they are unique. There are a few duplicates here, so only unique ones should be kept.

The 'tick_prescaler_zero' assertion ensures that when prescaler is 0, tick is high. This is correct as per the docs where prescaler 0 would generate a tick every cycle.

There's another 'tick_high_when_prescaler_zero' with a ##1 delay. That might not be correct because if prescaler is 0, tick should be high immediately. The one without the delay is accurate, so the version with ##1 is possibly incorrect and should be excluded. But need to check if the user wants all unique ones, even if they are conflicting. But the user said "valid" assertions, so that might be invalid. However, the user instructed not to modify the assertions, just return unique ones. So even if there's a duplicate, they are to be included as is.

The 'mtime_update_on_tick' assertions relate to mtime updating when tick occurs. These are not directly about the tick signal's behavior but about mtime. However, the user specified to extract assertions for the signal name "tick", so these might not be included. Wait, the user's instruction is to extract assertions for the signal "tick", regardless of other signals. So any assertion that mentions 'tick' in the property. For example, 'mtime_update_on_tick' involves tick as a condition, but the assertion's focus is on mtime. However, the user wants all assertions that involve the tick signal. So these should be included. Wait, no, the user says "for the signal name: tick". So the assertions that are about the behavior of the tick signal, not those that use tick as a condition to check other signals. So perhaps the 'mtime_update...' ones are not about the tick's own behavior but how mtime reacts to tick. But the user might consider all assertions where 'tick' is part of the property. The user's exact words: "Extract all unique and valid assertions from this list for the signal name: tick." So all assertions that are checking properties of the 'tick' signal. Wait, for example, an assertion that says "tick implies something about mtime" would be about mtime, not about tick. So maybe those shouldn't be included. The user wants assertions that verify the behavior of the tick signal itself, not other signals that depend on tick. But this is unclear. However, the examples given in the user's answer include the width assertion, reset behavior, active/inactive, periodicity, prescaler edge cases, etc. So likely, the 'mtime' related assertions should be excluded as they're about mtime, not tick. So I need to check each assertion to see if the property is about the behavior of the 'tick' signal.

Looking through the list:

- The first assertion: about the width of tick (valid, included).
- tick_async_reset: checks tick is low on reset (included).
- tick_inactive: checks tick is low when inactive (included).
- tick_periodicity: checks tick occurs every prescaler+1 cycles (included).
- tick_single_pulse_dynamic: ensures tick is single cycle unless prescaler 0 (included).
- prescaler_max_edge_case: edge case for max prescaler (included).
- tick_reset_inactive: multiple versions, check reset and active (included).
- tick_prescaler_zero: tick high when prescaler 0 (included).
- tick_single_pulse: same as dynamic but with different structure (included).
- tick_high_when_prescaler_zero: similar to tick_prescaler_zero but with ##1 (needs check if unique).
  
The 'mtime_update...' assertions are about mtime, not tick's behavior. So even though they involve tick as a trigger, the property is about mtime. Therefore, those should be excluded from the list for signal 'tick'.

Now, need to list all unique assertions that are about the tick signal's behavior:

1. Assertion about $bits(tick) ==1: included.
2. tick_async_reset: included.
3. tick_inactive: included.
4. tick_periodicity (two variations): need to check if they are duplicates. The first tick_periodicity uses $past(prescaler) and checks the next tick after last_prescaler cycles. The other uses a counter. They are different formulations, so both are unique and valid. However, the user might consider them as two separate assertions even if they check the same property. But maybe they are redundant. However, the user said to maximize retained assertions, so both should be kept if they are unique.
5. tick_single_pulse_dynamic: included.
6. prescaler_max_edge_case: included.
7. tick_reset_inactive: two versions. One disables iff (!rst_ni || !active) and the other does not. The 'tick_reset_inactive' appears multiple times. The exact code varies. Need to check each one. For example:

Original list has:

- 'property tick_reset_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active) \n  1 |-> !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_reset_inactive);'
- 'property tick_reset_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)\n  !rst_ni || !active |-> !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_reset_inactive);'
- Another one without disable iff: 'property tick_reset_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni || !active |-> !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_reset_inactive);'

These are similar but not identical. The first says "disable iff ... 1 |-> !tick", which is equivalent to checking always !tick when disabled. The second checks that when !rst_ni || !active, then !tick. The third is the same as the second, but without the disable iff. Depending on the tool, the disable iff might affect the evaluation. However, according to the user's instruction, we should not modify the assertions, just list them as-is. So even if some are duplicates in intent, their code is different, making them unique. So all three should be included.

Wait, but looking at the actual code:

1. First version: disable iff (!rst_ni || !active) then 1 |-> !tick. This means that whenever the disable condition is not active (i.e., rst_ni is high and active is high), then in all cases, !tick must hold. But that's not correct, because when active is high and rst_ni is high, the timer is running, so tick can pulse. So maybe this assertion is incorrect. However, the user said not to modify the assertions, just return them. So even if the assertion is wrong, include it if it's in the list. Wait, the user said "valid assertions" from the list. So only include those that are valid per the documentation.

In the documentation, when the timer is active and reset is not asserted, the tick can be generated. The assertion 'tick_reset_inactive' that says when rst_ni is low or active is low, then tick must be low. That is correct. So versions that state !rst_ni || !active |-> !tick are correct. The first version with 1 |-> !tick under disable iff would mean that when the disable condition is not active (rst_ni and active are high), then 1 (always) implies !tick. But that's not correct, because in normal operation, tick can be high. Therefore, this assertion is invalid. Wait, but the user instructed to extract all unique and valid assertions. So need to filter out invalid ones.

But how to determine validity? The documentation says that the timer can generate ticks when active and not in reset. So during active and reset not asserted, tick can be high. So any assertion that claims that when active is high and reset is high, tick must be low is invalid. So looking at the first tick_reset_inactive assertion:

property tick_reset_inactive;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  1 |-> !tick;
endproperty

This assertion is checking that in all cases (1 |-> ...), but when disabled (i.e., when !rst_ni or !active), it's disabled. So effectively, when rst_ni is high and active is high (disable iff is false), the assertion checks that !tick is always true. But this is incorrect because tick can be high. So this assertion is invalid and should be excluded. But the user may have included it in their list, but according to the documentation, it's invalid. However, the user instructed to extract all unique and valid assertions. So we need to check which ones align with the documentation.

This requires careful analysis. For example, the valid 'tick_reset_inactive' should check that when reset is asserted or inactive, tick is low. So:

property tick_reset_inactive;
  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni || !active |-> !tick;
endproperty

This is correct because in those conditions, tick should not be active. But another version that uses disable iff and checks 1 |-> !tick is incorrect because when not disabled (rst_ni high and active high), it forces tick to be low, which is wrong. So that assertion is invalid and should not be included.

Therefore, among the three 'tick_reset_inactive' assertions, only the ones that directly check the implication without the disable iff that incorrectly forces !tick in normal operation are valid. So the correct ones are:

- 'property tick_reset_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni || !active |-> !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_reset_inactive);'

But another version is:

property tick_reset_inactive;
  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)
  !rst_ni || !active |-> !tick;
endproperty
assert property (tick_reset_inactive);

In this case, the disable iff is redundant because the condition is the same as the antecedent. So when !rst_ni || !active is true, the property is checked, but since the antecedent is true, it should hold. However, the disable iff would disable the property when the condition is true, which is conflicting. This seems incorrect because the assertion is trying to check that during reset or inactive, tick is low, but disable iff would disable the check during those conditions. Therefore, this assertion is invalid. Only the version without disable iff is correct.

Therefore, the valid 'tick_reset_inactive' assertion is:

property tick_reset_inactive;
  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni || !active |-> !tick;
endproperty
assert property (tick_reset_inactive);

The other versions are incorrect and should be excluded. So in the user's list, the valid one is this last version.

Another assertion is 'tick_reset_inactive' with disable iff (!rst_ni || !active) and the implication is !rst_ni || !active |-> !tick. However, the disable iff would disable the check when the antecedent is true, making the assertion never check the condition. This is incorrect, so it's invalid.

So among the list, the valid 'tick_reset_inactive' is the one that doesn't have the disable iff and directly checks the implication.

Now, going back to the user's list, there are multiple instances of 'tick_reset_inactive'. Let's look at each:

1. 'property tick_reset_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active) \n  1 |-> !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_reset_inactive);' → Invalid, as explained.

2. 'property tick_reset_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)\n  !rst_ni || !active |-> !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_reset_inactive);' → Invalid because disable iff disables the check when the antecedent is true.

3. 'property tick_reset_inactive;\n  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni || !active |-> !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_reset_inactive);' → Correct.

So only the third version is valid and should be included.

Moving on to the 'tick_prescaler_zero' and 'tick_high_when_prescaler_zero' assertions:

The first says that when prescaler is 0, tick is high. The second says when prescaler is 0, after one cycle, tick is high. Which is correct? The documentation states that if the prescaler is 0, the tick is generated every cycle. So when prescaler is 0, the tick should be high every cycle. Therefore, the assertion without the ##1 is correct, while the one with ##1 would check that in the next cycle, but this might not hold. For example, if prescaler is 0, the tick should be high in the same cycle as prescaler is 0, not the next. Thus, the assertion with ##1 is incorrect. But according to the user's instruction, we should include all unique ones without modifying them, even if they are incorrect. However, the user said "valid" assertions, so we need to check if they align with the documentation.

The documentation's tick generator creates a tick every time the internal counter hits the prescaler value. The prescaler is 12 bits, and the step is added when the tick occurs. When prescaler is 0, the counter would hit 0 immediately, so the tick would be generated every cycle. Therefore, when prescaler is 0, tick should be high every cycle. So the assertion 'tick_prescaler_zero' (without ##1) is correct. The one with ##1 is incorrect and should be excluded.

But looking at the list, there's:

'property tick_high_when_prescaler_zero;\n  @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)\n  (prescaler == 0) |-> ##1 tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_high_when_prescaler_zero);'

This is invalid because it requires tick one cycle after prescaler is 0, but according to docs, it should be high in the same cycle. However, this assertion is in the user's list. The user wants all unique and valid assertions. Since this is not valid, it should be excluded. But how to determine that?

Wait, the user said to extract assertions that are valid, but without modifying them. If the user provided an assertion that is incorrect according to the documentation, but the user wants to retain as many as possible, but only valid ones, we need to determine validity based on the doc.

But according to the documentation:

The prescaler generates a tick when the internal counter reaches the prescaler value. So when prescaler is 0, the counter increments each cycle. When does the tick occur? Let's think: the prescaler's internal counter starts at 0. On each clock cycle, if active and not in reset, the counter increments. When it reaches the prescaler value, a tick is generated, and the counter resets to 0. So for prescaler =0, the counter increments to 1 on the next cycle, but since prescaler is 0, the counter never reaches it. Wait, this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the internal counter counts up, and when it reaches the prescaler value, the tick is generated. So for prescaler=0, the counter starts at 0, and on the next cycle, it increments to 1. But since the prescaler is 0, it never reaches that value. Wait, that can't be. Oh, maybe the comparison is >= prescaler. Or perhaps the counter is compared for equality with the prescaler. The documentation says: "the tick is created every time its internal counter hits the CFG@.prescaler value". So when the internal counter equals the prescaler value, a tick is generated. So if prescaler is 0, the counter starts at 0. On the first cycle, counter is 0, so a tick is generated, then the counter resets. So every cycle, the counter is 0, hence a tick is generated every cycle. So when prescaler is 0, the tick should be high every cycle. Thus, the assertion 'tick_prescaler_zero' that says (prescaler ==0) |-> tick is correct. The one with ##1 is incorrect.

Therefore, the 'tick_high_when_prescaler_zero' with ##1 is invalid and should be excluded. Only the one without ##1 is valid.

Similarly, the 'tick_single_pulse' assertion says that after a tick, in the next cycle, either prescaler is 0 or tick is low. This ensures that tick is a single pulse unless prescaler is 0. Which is correct, because with prescaler 0, tick stays high every cycle.

Now, compiling all valid and unique assertions about the 'tick' signal:

1. Width assertion: 'assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(tick) == 1);' → Must include.

2. tick_async_reset: Ensures tick is low on reset. Valid.

3. tick_inactive: When inactive, tick is low. Valid as per doc.

4. tick_periodicity (two variations): Need to check if both are valid. The first uses $past(prescaler) and checks that after a tick, the next tick is after prescaler +1 cycles. The second counts cycles between ticks. Both are valid ways to check periodicity. So include both if they are unique.

5. tick_single_pulse_dynamic: After a tick (with prescaler !=0), next cycle tick is low. Valid.

6. prescaler_max_edge_case: Checks max prescaler value (4095) causes ticks every 4096 cycles. Valid.

7. tick_reset_inactive: Only the version without disable iff and checks !rst_ni || !active → !tick. Valid.

8. tick_prescaler_zero: When prescaler is 0, tick is high. Valid.

9. tick_single_pulse: Ensures tick is single cycle unless prescaler is 0. Valid.

The other 'tick_high_when_prescaler_zero' with ##1 is invalid and excluded. The 'mtime_update...' assertions are about mtime, not tick, so excluded.

Now, check for uniqueness. For example, there are two tick_periodicity properties. Since their code is different, but the intention is same, but the user wants to maximize retained assertions, so include both as unique.

Similarly, tick_single_pulse and tick_single_pulse_dynamic are different expressions but similar intent. They are unique in code, so include both.

The 'tick_reset_inactive' valid version is only one (as per earlier analysis).

In the user's list, the valid tick-related assertions are:

- 'assert property (@(posedge clk_i) $bits(tick) == 1);' → width check.

- 'property tick_async_reset;\n @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_async_reset);' → async reset.

- 'property tick_inactive;\n @(posedge clk_i) !active |-> !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_inactive);' → inactive state.

- The first tick_periodicity: 

'property tick_periodicity;\n int last_prescaler;\n @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)\n ($rose(tick), last_prescaler = $past(prescaler)) |-> \n ##1 (!tick throughout (last_prescaler)) ##1 tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_periodicity);'

- The second tick_periodicity:

'property tick_periodicity;\n int cnt;\n @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)\n ($rose(tick), cnt=0) ##0 (1, cnt++)[*0:$] ##1 $rose(tick) |-> cnt == prescaler + 1;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_periodicity);'

These are two different implementations for the same check. Both are about the period between ticks being prescaler +1. However, they are written differently. The user wants to maximize retained assertions, so include both.

- 'property tick_single_pulse_dynamic;\n @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)\n tick && $past(prescaler) != 0 |=> !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_single_pulse_dynamic);'

- 'property prescaler_max_edge_case;\n @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)\n (prescaler == 4095) && tick |-> ##4096 tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (prescaler_max_edge_case);'

- Valid tick_reset_inactive: 'property tick_reset_inactive;\n @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni || !active |-> !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_reset_inactive);'

- 'property tick_prescaler_zero;\n @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)\n (prescaler == 0) |-> tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_prescaler_zero);'

- 'property tick_single_pulse;\n @(posedge clk_i) disable iff (!rst_ni || !active)\n tick |=> (prescaler == 0) || !tick;\nendproperty\nassert property (tick_single_pulse);'

Now, check if any of these are duplicates. For example, the 'tick_reset_inactive' and 'tick_async_reset' both relate to reset but cover different aspects. 'tick_async_reset' checks the falling edge of reset, while 'tick_reset_inactive' checks the steady state during reset.

Similarly, the 'tick_single_pulse' and 'tick_single_pulse_dynamic' are different formulations but similar intent. They are unique.

The 'tick_periodicity' properties are the same in intent but different in code; both are considered unique.

Therefore, all these assertions should be included.
