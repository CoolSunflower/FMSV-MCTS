It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

The Byte Command Controller tells the Bit Command Controller\nwhich operation has to be performed. For a single byte read, the Bit Command Controller\nreceives 8 separate read commands. Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal sda_pad_i based on the provided specification. Let's start by understanding the role of sda_pad_i in the I2C core.\n\nFirst, the description says sda_pad_i is a 1-bit input that samples the external SDA line. Since it's part of an open-drain bus, the signal should be pulled up externally. The tri-state buffers are managed by sda_pad_o and sda_pad_oe. When sda_pad_oe is high, the output is disabled (high-Z), and the line is pulled up externally, so sda_pad_i should read high. When sda_pad_oe is low, the core is driving the line, so sda_pad_i should match sda_pad_o.\n\nNow, considering the types of assertions required: width, connectivity, and functionality.\n\nWidth: Since sda_pad_i is a 1-bit signal, the width assertion is straightforward. Check that it's indeed 1 bit using $bits.\n\nConnectivity: Need to ensure that when the core is driving SDA (sda_pad_oe is 0), the input sda_pad_i reflects the output sda_pad_o. Conversely, when the core isn't driving (sda_pad_oe is 1), sda_pad_i should be high due to external pull-up. However, since the actual pull-up is external, the assertion can't directly check for high, but can check that when the core is driving, the input matches the output.\n\nFunctionality: Check that during data transfer phases (when TIP is high), the SDA line behaves correctly. For example, during a write, the core drives SDA, so sda_pad_i should match sda_pad_o when oe is low. During a read, the core releases the line (oe high), so sda_pad_i is from the slave.\n\nAlso, during SCL high phases, SDA should be stable except for start/stop conditions. But since start/stop are generated by the master, maybe check that when the core is not driving, SDA changes only when SCL is low. However, this might be complex as it involves checking transitions relative to SCL.\n\nWait, the core's Bit Command Controller handles the SCL and SDA lines. For functionality, maybe check that when the core is driving (oe low), sda_pad_i equals sda_pad_o. When not driving (oe high), the core's input is from the external line, but we can't assert on external signals. However, the connectivity with the tri-state buffer can be checked.\n\nAnother point: The specification mentions that SDA should only change when SCL is low. So, during SCL high, sda_pad_i should remain stable unless it's a start or stop condition. But since start/stop are generated by the master, maybe the core's driving of SDA during those conditions. However, this might be covered by the connectivity assertions.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check sda_pad_i is 1 bit.\n2. Connectivity: When oe is low, sda_pad_i should equal sda_pad_o. When oe is high, no constraint since it's external, but maybe check that the core isn't driving.\n3. Functionality: During transfers, when the core is driving (oe low), data is as expected. Also, during SCL high phases, SDA is stable unless it's a start/stop.\n\nBut how to model start/stop? The start condition is SDA going low while SCL is high. The stop is SDA going high while SCL is high. These are generated by the master, so when the core is generating start/stop, oe would be low, and sda_pad_i should follow sda_pad_o.\n\nWait, but during start/stop, the core is driving SDA. So during SCL high, if the core is driving a start (SDA falling), then sda_pad_i should reflect that. But since the core is driving, oe is low, so sda_pad_i should equal sda_pad_o.\n\nAnother angle: When the core is not driving (oe high), SDA is pulled up, so sda_pad_i should be 1. But this depends on external factors, so maybe not assertable. However, in the FPGA implementation, the tri-state is handled, so when oe is high, the core's sda_pad_i should be the value of the external SDA line, which in the absence of any drivers would be high. But if another device is driving it low, then sda_pad_i would be low. So we can't assume it's always high when oe is high. Therefore, connectivity assertion can only check that when the core is driving, the input matches the output.\n\nSo the connectivity assertion would be: When sda_pad_oe is 0 (core driving), sda_pad_i should equal sda_pad_o. Because the external line is driven by the core, so the input should reflect the output.\n\nFor functionality, during a write operation (core is sending data), each bit on SDA should be stable during SCL high. So when SCL is high, sda_pad_i should not change. But since the core is driving, this would be ensured by the connectivity assertion. However, during a read, the slave drives SDA, so the core's oe is high, and sda_pad_i samples the slave's data.\n\nAdditionally, during the 9th clock cycle (ACK), the slave drives SDA. The core should check the ACK bit, which is captured in the status register's RxACK bit. But that's more of a functional check on the status register, not directly on sda_pad_i.\n\nAnother functional check: After a start condition, the first bit is the address. But this is handled by the Byte Command Controller, so maybe not directly related to sda_pad_i.\n\nPutting it all together, the key assertions are:\n\n- Width: 1 bit.\n- Connectivity: When oe is low, sda_pad_i == sda_pad_o.\n- Functionality: During SCL high phases, if the core is driving (oe low), SDA remains stable. Also, start/stop conditions are correctly generated.\n\nBut how to check SDA stability during SCL high? Maybe using past values. For example, during SCL high, sda_pad_i should not change unless it's a start or stop. But since start/stop are generated by the core, when oe is low, the core controls SDA. So during SCL high, if oe is low, sda_pad_i (which is sda_pad_o) should remain stable. Wait, but during a start condition, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high. So in that case, the SDA would change during SCL high, which is allowed only for start/stop.\n\nThis is a bit complex. Maybe the functionality assertion should check that when the core is driving (oe low), any change in SDA during SCL high is only for start or stop conditions.\n\nAlternatively, since the core's internal logic should handle generating start/stop correctly, perhaps the connectivity assertion covers the main point, and the functionality is ensured by the core's correct operation.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the main assertions are:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. Connectivity: When driving, input matches output.\n3. When not driving, the core's output is high-Z (handled by external tri-state, but not directly assertable here).\n\nAdditionally, during SCL high, if the core is driving, SDA should not change except for start/stop. But modeling this would require tracking the core's state (e.g., in start or stop generation).\n\nAlternatively, since the core's internal logic should manage SDA correctly, maybe the key assertion is the connectivity one.\n\nSo the final SVAs would be:\n\n- Width: Check sda_pad_i is 1 bit.\n- Connectivity: When sda_pad_oe is low, sda_pad_i equals sda_pad_o.\n- Functionality: During SCL high, if the core is driving (oe low), SDA remains stable unless it's a start or stop condition. But modeling start/stop requires knowing when those conditions are being generated, which might involve internal signals like STA or STO bits in the command register.\n\nAlternatively, since the specification mentions that transitions on SDA while SCL is high are considered start/stop, perhaps an assertion that checks that any change in sda_pad_i during SCL high is only when the core is generating start or stop.\n\nBut without access to internal signals like STA or STO, this might be challenging. However, the command register's STA and STO bits are write-only and cleared automatically, so they might not be directly observable in assertions.\n\nGiven the information available, the most feasible assertions are the width and connectivity checks. For functionality, perhaps check that during transfers (TIP high), when the core is driving, SDA is stable during SCL high phases.\n\nBut how to implement that? For example, during SCL high, if oe is low, then sda_pad_i should not change. But during a start condition, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high, which would violate this. So this assertion would fail during start. Hence, the assertion needs to account for start and stop conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the core's internal FSM ensures that SDA changes only during allowed times, so the connectivity assertion suffices.\n\nIn conclusion, the key SVAs are:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. Connectivity: When oe is low, sda_pad_i equals sda_pad_o.\n3. Functionality: During SCL high, if the core is driving (oe low), SDA remains stable unless a start or stop is being generated. However, without internal state signals, this is hard to model. Instead, rely on the connectivity assertion and assume the core's logic handles timing correctly.\n\nTherefore, the generated SVAs would include the width and connectivity checks. For functionality, perhaps check that during data phases (not start/stop), SDA is stable when SCL is high. But without knowing when start/stop occur, this is tricky. Maybe omit this for now and stick to the connectivity and width.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: `sda_pad_i` is defined as 1-bit, so verify its width.\n2. **Connectivity**: Ensure `sda_pad_i` matches `sda_pad_o` when the core drives SDA (`sda_pad_oe` low).

This mixes input/output roles.\n   - **Flaw 2**: The assertion attempts to check stability during SCL high but uses `scl_pad_i` (input) instead of the core’s driven SCL (`scl_pad_o`). This fails in multi-master scenarios where SCL is stretched by another device.\n   - **Flaw 3**: Fails to exclude START/STOP conditions.

The core must ensure SDA transitions only during SCL high for these events.\n   - **Flaw 5**: No check for arbitration loss (`AL` bit).

Therefore, connectivity assertion can only check that when the core is driving, the input matches the output.\n\nSo the connectivity assertion would be: When sda_pad_oe is 0 (core driving), sda_pad_i should equal sda_pad_o. Because the external line is driven by the core, so the input should reflect the output.\n\nFor functionality, during a write operation (core is sending data), each bit on SDA should be stable during SCL high. So when SCL is high, sda_pad_i should not change. But since the core is driving, this would be ensured by the connectivity assertion. However, during a read, the slave drives SDA, so the core\'s oe is high, and sda_pad_i samples the slave\'s data.\n\nAdditionally, during the 9th clock cycle (ACK), the slave drives SDA. The core should check the ACK bit, which is captured in the status register\'s RxACK bit. But that\'s more of a functional check on the status register, not directly on sda_pad_i.\n\nAnother functional check: After a start condition, the first bit is the address. But this is handled by the Byte Command Controller, so maybe not directly related to sda_pad_i.\n\nPutting it all together, the key assertions are:\n\n- Width: 1 bit.\n- Connectivity: When oe is low, sda_pad_i == sda_pad_o.\n- Functionality: During SCL high phases, if the core is driving (oe low), SDA remains stable. Also, start/stop conditions are correctly generated.\n\nBut how to check SDA stability during SCL high? Maybe using past values. For example, during SCL high, sda_pad_i should not change unless it\'s a start or stop. But since start/stop are generated by the core, when oe is low, the core controls SDA. So during SCL high, if oe is low, sda_pad_i (which is sda_pad_o) should remain stable. Wait, but during a start condition, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high. So in that case, the SDA would change during SCL high, which is allowed only for start/stop.\n\nThis is a bit complex. Maybe the functionality assertion should check that when the core is driving (oe low), any change in SDA during SCL high is only for start or stop conditions.\n\nAlternatively, since the core\'s internal logic should handle generating start/stop correctly, perhaps the connectivity assertion covers the main point, and the functionality is ensured by the core\'s correct operation.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the main assertions are:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. Connectivity: When driving, input matches output.\n3. When not driving, the core\'s output is high-Z (handled by external tri-state, but not directly assertable here).\n\nAdditionally, during SCL high, if the core is driving, SDA should not change except for start/stop. But modeling this would require tracking the core\'s state (e.g., in start or stop generation).\n\nAlternatively, since the core\'s internal logic should manage SDA correctly, maybe the key assertion is the connectivity one.\n\nSo the final SVAs would be:\n\n- Width: Check sda_pad_i is 1 bit.\n- Connectivity: When sda_pad_oe is low, sda_pad_i equals sda_pad_o.\n- Functionality: During SCL high, if the core is driving (oe low), SDA remains stable unless it\'s a start or stop condition. But modeling start/stop requires knowing when those conditions are being generated, which might involve internal signals like STA or STO bits in the command register.\n\nAlternatively, since the specification mentions that transitions on SDA while SCL is high are considered start/stop, perhaps an assertion that checks that any change in sda_pad_i during SCL high is only when the core is generating start or stop.\n\nBut without access to internal signals like STA or STO, this might be challenging. However, the command register\'s STA and STO bits are write-only and cleared automatically, so they might not be directly observable in assertions.\n\nGiven the information available, the most feasible assertions are the width and connectivity checks. For functionality, perhaps check that during transfers (TIP high), when the core is driving, SDA is stable during SCL high phases.\n\nBut how to implement that? For example, during SCL high, if oe is low, then sda_pad_i should not change. But during a start condition, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high, which would violate this. So this assertion would fail during start. Hence, the assertion needs to account for start and stop conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the core\'s internal FSM ensures that SDA changes only during allowed times, so the connectivity assertion suffices.\n\nIn conclusion, the key SVAs are:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. Connectivity: When oe is low, sda_pad_i equals sda_pad_o.\n3. Functionality: During SCL high, if the core is driving (oe low), SDA remains stable unless a start or stop is being generated. However, without internal state signals, this is hard to model. Instead, rely on the connectivity assertion and assume the core\'s logic handles timing correctly.\n\nTherefore, the generated SVAs would include the width and connectivity checks. For functionality, perhaps check that during data phases (not start/stop), SDA is stable when SCL is high. But without knowing when start/stop occur, this is tricky. Maybe omit this for now and stick to the connectivity and width.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: `sda_pad_i` is defined as 1-bit, so verify its width.\n2. **Connectivity**: Ensure `sda_pad_i` matches `sda_pad_o` when the core drives SDA (`sda_pad_oe` low). When not driving (`sda_pad_oe` high), the external pull-up ensures `sda_pad_i` is high (but depends on external factors, so not directly assertable).\n3. **Functionality**: During SCL high phases, SDA should remain stable unless for START/STOP. However, since START/STOP are generated by the core, connectivity assertions cover this when driving. For non-driving cases, stability is ensured by external devices.\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check using `$bits`.\n- **Connectivity**: Assert `sda_pad_i` equals `sda_pad_o` when output is enabled.\n- **Functionality**: Stability during SCL high is implied by correct connectivity and core logic.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion for sda_pad_i\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) ($bits(sda_pad_i) == 1));\n\n// Connectivity: When core drives SDA, input reflects output\nproperty sda_connectivity;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (sda_pad_oe == 1\'b0) |-> (sda_pad_i == sda_pad_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (sda_connectivity);\n\n// Functionality: SDA stability during SCL high when driving (no transitions unless START/STOP)\nproperty sda_stable_during_scl_high;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (scl_pad_oe == 1\'b0 && $rose(scl_pad_i)) |-> ##1 ($stable(sda_pad_i) throughout (scl_pad_i[->1]));\nendproperty\nassert property (sda_stable_during_scl_high);\n``` \n\n[Answer]\nThe SVAs ensure:\n1. **Width**: `sda_pad_i` is 1-bit.\n2. **Connectivity**: When driving, `sda_pad_i` matches `sda_pad_o`.\n3. **Functionality**: SDA remains stable during SCL high when core is driving, adhering to I2C protocol..\n\nAccording to the Feedback: <think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis and Feedback:**\n\n1. **Width Assertion**:\n   - **Correctness**: Correctly checks that `sda_pad_i` is 1-bit. No issues.\n   - **Score**: +10 (No flaws).\n\n2. **Connectivity Assertion**:\n   - **Flaw 1**: Assumes `sda_pad_i` directly equals `sda_pad_o` when `sda_pad_oe` is low. This ignores propagation delays and synchronization. In real hardware, there might be a clock cycle delay between `sda_pad_o` and `sda_pad_i` due to external tri-state buffers.\n   - **Flaw 2**: Does not account for metastability or glitches during transitions of `sda_pad_oe`. The assertion could fail transiently during enable/disable.\n   - **Score**: -20 (Propagation delay and metastability ignored).\n\n3. **Functionality Assertion** (`sda_stable_during_scl_high`):\n   - **Flaw 1**: The antecedent `(scl_pad_oe == 1\'b0 && $rose(scl_pad_i))` is incorrect. `scl_pad_oe` being low means the core drives SCL, but `$rose(scl_pad_i)` checks for a rising edge on the input SCL, which is not directly controlled by the core. This mixes input/output roles.\n   - **Flaw 2**: The assertion attempts to check stability during SCL high but uses `scl_pad_i` (input) instead of the core’s driven SCL (`scl_pad_o`). This fails in multi-master scenarios where SCL is stretched by another device.\n   - **Flaw 3**: Fails to exclude START/STOP conditions. During START (SDA↓ while SCL high) or STOP (SDA↑ while SCL high), SDA intentionally changes, violating the assertion.\n   - **Score**: -40 (Incorrect signal references, ignores START/STOP).\n\n4. **Missing Assertions**:\n   - **Flaw 4**: No check for START/STOP conditions. The core must ensure SDA transitions only during SCL high for these events.\n   - **Flaw 5**: No check for arbitration loss (`AL` bit). If another master drives SDA low while the core drives high, `sda_pad_i` should reflect this, triggering arbitration loss.\n   - **Flaw 6**: No check for ACK/NACK handling during reads. When `sda_pad_oe` is high (core not driving), `sda_pad_i` should match the slave’s response.\n   - **Score**: -30 (Critical scenarios unverified).\n\n5. **Clock Cycle Misinterpretations**:\n   - **Flaw 7**: Assumes immediate effect of `sda_pad_oe` on `sda_pad_i`. In reality, external buffer delays could cause mismatches between `sda_pad_o` and `sda_pad_i` within the same cycle.\n   - **Score**: -10.\n\n6. **Nested Conditions**:\n   - **Flaw 8**: The `sda_stable_during_scl_high` assertion uses a complex `throughout` operator but lacks clarity. It should explicitly model SCL high periods using `scl_pad_o` (core’s driven SCL) instead of `scl_pad_i`.\n   - **Score**: -10.\n\n**Total Score**:  \nInitial Score (100) - 20 (Flaw 2) - 40 (Flaw 3) - 30 (Flaw 4-6) - 10 (Flaw 7) - 10 (Flaw 8) = **-10/100**.\n\n**Critical Feedback**:\n- The SVAs fail to handle real-world timing (propagation delays, metastability).\n- Incorrectly references SCL input instead of core-driven SCL output.\n- Ignores START/STOP conditions and arbitration loss.\n- Lacks checks for ACK/NACK and multi-master scenarios.\n- Overlooks synchronization between `sda_pad_oe` and `sda_pad_i`.\n\n**Improvements**:\n1. Use `scl_pad_o` instead of `scl_pad_i` in functionality assertions.\n2. Exclude START/STOP conditions from SDA stability checks.\n3. Add assertions for arbitration loss and ACK/NACK handling.\n4. Model buffer delays with `##1` in connectivity assertions.\n5. Use `@(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (!wb_rst_i))` to handle resets..

LLM Output: <think>

Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `sda_pad_i` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. 

First, I need to recall the issues identified in the previous answer. The main problems were:
1. **Connectivity Assertion**: Didn't account for propagation delays and metastability.
2. **Functionality Assertion**: Incorrectly referenced `scl_pad_i` instead of `scl_pad_o`, leading to potential false failures in multi-master scenarios.
3. **Missing Checks**: No handling of START/STOP conditions, arbitration loss, or ACK/NACK.

**Step 1: Width Assertion**
- The width check is straightforward. `sda_pad_i` is defined as 1-bit, so the assertion remains valid. No changes needed here.

**Step 2: Connectivity Assertion**
- The original assertion assumed immediate equality between `sda_pad_i` and `sda_pad_o` when `sda_pad_oe` is low. However, in real hardware, there might be a delay due to tri-state buffers. To address this, I'll add a `##1` delay to account for one clock cycle propagation delay.
- Also, include a disable condition for reset to avoid false failures during reset.

**Step 3: Functionality Assertion**
- The original assertion used `scl_pad_i` (input SCL), which isn't reliable in multi-master setups. Instead, use `scl_pad_o` (core-driven SCL) to check stability during SCL high phases.
- Need to exclude START/STOP conditions. Since the core generates these, monitor the Command Register (`cr`) for STA (start) and STO (stop) commands. If either is active, allow SDA transitions during SCL high.
- Use `$stable` to ensure SDA doesn't change unless during START/STOP.

**Step 4: Arbitration Loss Check**
- The status register (`sr`) has an Arbitration Lost (`AL`) bit. If another master drives SDA low while the core drives it high, `AL` should trigger. This can be checked by ensuring that when the core is driving (`sda_pad_oe` low), if `sda_pad_i` is low but `sda_pad_o` is high, `AL` is set in the next cycle.

**Step 5: ACK/NACK Handling**
- During read operations (when `sda_pad_oe` is high), the slave drives SDA. The core should capture this in the Receive Register (`rxr`). However, this is more about the status register and might not directly involve `sda_pad_i` assertions. Maybe skip this unless specified.

**Step 6: START/STOP Condition Checks**
- Add assertions to verify that START (SDA↓ while SCL high) and STOP (SDA↑ while SCL high) are correctly generated when the respective commands (STA, STO) are issued.

**Final Adjustments**:
- Use `disable iff (wb_rst_i)` to handle resets.
- Ensure all assertions reference the correct signals (e.g., `scl_pad_o` instead of `scl_pad_i`).
- Test for metastability by allowing a clock cycle delay in connectivity checks.

By addressing these points, the revised SVAs should be more robust and aligned with the specification and feedback.

**Key Improvements**:
1. **Propagation Delay**: Added `##1` in connectivity assertion to model tri-state buffer latency.
2. **Core-Driven SCL**: Replaced `scl_pad_i` with `scl_pad_o` to avoid multi-master interference.
3. **START/STOP Exclusion**: Used Command Register (`cr[3:2]`) to disable stability checks during these events.
4. **Arbitration Loss**: Directly checks if `AL` bit sets when core drives high but SDA is low.
5. **Reset Handling**: Added `disable iff (wb_rst_i)` to all assertions.
6. **Explicit START/STOP**: Added dedicated assertions to validate protocol-critical transitions.
