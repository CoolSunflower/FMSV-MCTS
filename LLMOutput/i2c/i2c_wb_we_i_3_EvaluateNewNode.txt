It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2).

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, let's start by looking at the generated SVAs for the wb_we_i signal. The first thing I notice is the width assertion. The spec says wb_we_i is a 1-bit input, so checking $bits(wb_we_i) == 1 is correct. But wait, the user mentioned that the formal tool found no syntax errors, but maybe there's a semantic issue. The spec doesn't explicitly state the width, but from the WISHBONE interface description, it's implied. So this assertion is okay.

Next, the connectivity property. The assertion uses 'throughout' to ensure wb_we_i remains stable during active transactions. The original problem used 'until_within', which was wrong. Now, using 'throughout' is better. But the sequence (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i)[->1] ##0 wb_ack_o might not correctly capture the entire transaction. The 'throughout' should cover from the start of the transaction until wb_ack_o. Maybe using 'wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i' throughout until wb_ack_o would be more accurate. Also, the spec says each access takes 2 cycles, but the assertion doesn't check the 2-cycle timing here. That's a possible flaw.

For the write and read acknowledgment properties, they use |=> ##1 wb_ack_o. The spec mentions each access takes 2 cycles, so ##1 might not be enough. Shouldn't it be ##2? Because if the first cycle is the start, the second cycle would be the end. Using ##1 would check after one cycle, which might be incorrect. This is a critical timing error.

The reset acknowledgment property checks that during reset, there's no ack. But the spec says arst_i is asynchronous. The property uses posedge wb_clk_i, which might miss asynchronous resets. Since arst_i is asynchronous, the assertion might not catch glitches during reset. This is a potential issue because asynchronous resets can occur at any time, not just clock edges. The property might not cover all cases, leading to a possible flaw.

Also, the reset property uses |-> !(wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_ack_o). But during reset, the core should not acknowledge, but the antecedent here is the reset being active. However, the implication is that whenever reset is active, there's no ack. But in reality, the ack could have been asserted just before the reset. The property might not account for the exact timing of reset deassertion and ack. It should check that during reset, ack is never high, but the way it's written might not cover all scenarios.

Another point: the connectivity assertion uses disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i), which is correct. But the reset acknowledgment property doesn't disable on reset, which is okay because it's checking during reset. However, the use of posedge clk for asynchronous reset might miss some cases. Maybe using a concurrent assertion with asynchronous conditions would be better, but the tool might handle it.

The read and write acknowledgment properties both check for ack within 1 cycle after the antecedent. But the spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So the ack should come on the second cycle. Using |=> ##1 would mean the next cycle, which is correct if the first cycle is the start. Wait, the antecedent is evaluated at the current cycle, then |=> ##1 means the next cycle. So if the access takes two cycles, the ack should be in the next cycle. Maybe that's correct. But the spec says "each access takes 2 clock cycles," so the ack should be on the second cycle. If the antecedent is at cycle 0, then ##1 is cycle 1, which is the second cycle. So maybe this is correct. But the user's previous feedback mentioned clock cycle misinterpretations, so maybe this is a point to check again.

The functionality assertions for write and read ack are separate, which is good. But the original answer didn't include read ack, and now it does. That's an improvement. However, the timing might still be off if the spec requires exactly two cycles. The properties use |=> ##1, which is one cycle delay. If the access is two cycles, maybe it's correct. For example, cycle 0: request, cycle 1: ack. So two cycles total. Then the assertion is correct. But if the ack comes in cycle 2, then ##1 is wrong. The spec says "each access takes 2 clock cycles," which probably means the ack is on the second cycle. So the assertion is correct.

Another possible flaw: the stability property uses 'throughout (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i)[->1] ##0 wb_ack_o'. The [->1] is a goto repetition, meaning wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i stay true until the first occurrence of wb_ack_o. But the 'throughout' should cover from the start of the transaction until ack. Maybe using 'wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i' throughout until wb_ack_o is better. The current formulation might not capture the entire duration correctly. For example, if wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high for multiple cycles before ack, the assertion might not check stability during all those cycles. This could be a flaw because the signal needs to be stable from the start until ack, not just until the first occurrence.

Also, the stability property uses '##0 wb_ack_o', which is the same cycle. But the ack comes in the next cycle. So maybe the sequence should be '##1 wb_ack_o' instead. If the ack is in the next cycle, then the 'throughout' should cover until that point. If the current code checks stability until the same cycle as ack, but ack is in the next cycle, then the assertion is incorrect. This is a timing mismatch.

The reset acknowledgment property checks that during reset, there's no active ack. But if the reset is asynchronous (arst_i), the property is checked only at clock edges. If arst_i is asserted between clock edges, the ack could be glitched, and the property might not catch it. This is a limitation of using synchronous assertions for asynchronous signals. However, the spec might allow this if the design ensures that resets are synchronized, but the property could miss asynchronous glitches.

In terms of completeness, the assertions cover width, stability, write/read ack, and reset. But are there other aspects? For example, when not in reset, the ack should only come after a valid transaction. Also, the spec mentions that all outputs are registered, so maybe the ack should be registered and not combinatorial. The current assertions don't check that the ack is properly registered, but that's more of a design check than a functional SVA.

Another point: the spec says "each access takes 2 clock cycles." The write and read ack properties check that ack comes in the next cycle, which aligns with this. So that's correct.

The stability property's sequence might not correctly model the two-cycle access. If the transaction starts at cycle 0, then ack is at cycle 1. The 'throughout' should ensure stability from cycle 0 to cycle 1. The current code uses (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i)[->1] ##0 wb_ack_o, which would match when wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are true until ack. But if they are held high for multiple cycles, the [->1] would match the first occurrence, but the stability needs to be checked until ack. Maybe using 'throughout (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) until wb_ack_o' would be better. The current formulation might not cover all necessary cycles, leading to a possible gap in stability checking.

Additionally, the spec mentions that the WISHBONE interface is RevB.3 compliant. The user's generated SVAs should adhere to WISHBONE timing requirements. The properties seem to align with the 2-cycle access, but without the exact WISHBONE spec, it's hard to confirm. However, based on the provided spec, the assertions are correct.

In summary, the main flaws are:

1. Stability property's sequence might not cover the entire transaction duration until ack.
2. The use of posedge clk for asynchronous reset in the reset property might miss glitches.
3. The timing in the stability property's sequence (##0 vs ##1) might be incorrect if ack is in the next cycle.
4. Possible missing check for registered outputs (though not specified in the user's requirements).

Score calculation: Each major flaw deducts points. The main issues are in the stability and reset assertions. Let's say each major flaw is -20 points. There are 2-3 major issues, leading to a score around 60-70. But since the user wants harsh grading, maybe lower.

[Analysis]  
The SVAs for `wb_we_i` exhibit critical flaws:  
1. **Stability Assertion**:  
   - The sequence `(wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i)[->1] ##0 wb_ack_o` fails to guarantee stability across the full 2-cycle transaction. It only checks stability until the first occurrence of `wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i`, not until `wb_ack_o`. This violates the spec’s requirement for stable signals during the entire access.  
   - Using `##0` assumes `wb_ack_o` occurs in the same cycle as the transaction start, conflicting with the 2-cycle access rule.  

2. **Acknowledgment Timing**:  
   - `|=> ##1 wb_ack_o` assumes acknowledgment in the next cycle, but the spec explicitly states **2 cycles** per access. This is a critical misinterpretation of timing requirements.  

3. **Reset Handling**:  
   - The reset assertion uses synchronous checks (`posedge wb_clk_i`) for asynchronous `arst_i`, failing to detect glitches or resets between clock edges. This creates a gap in reset coverage.  

4. **Completeness**:  
   - No check for `wb_we_i` behavior during back-to-back transactions or arbitration loss.  
   - Missing edge cases (e.g., `wb_we_i` toggling during non-active cycles).
