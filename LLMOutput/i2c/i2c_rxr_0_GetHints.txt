It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the rxr signal based on the provided specification. Let's start by understanding what rxr is. From the description, rxr is an 8-bit read-only register that holds the last byte received via I2C. It's part of the WISHBONE interface and is connected to the DataIO Shift Register. The reset value is 0x00.\n\nFirst, the width assertion. Since rxr is 8 bits, I should check that its width is indeed 8 bits. Using $bits(rxr) should equal 8. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, connectivity. The rxr is loaded from the DataIO Shift Register after a read operation. So I need to ensure that when a read transfer completes (sr[3] is TIP, and it goes low, and sr[0] is IF, which is set), the rxr gets the value from the shift register. But the problem is, the DataIO Shift Register isn't a signal provided here. The related signals are txr, cr, sr. Maybe I can infer that when a read is done, rxr should update. Alternatively, since the status register's TIP bit goes low and IF goes high, that's when the data is available. So maybe an assertion that when IF goes high after a read command, rxr is updated. But how to track the shift register's value? Since the shift register isn't a signal I can access, maybe I can't check the exact value. But perhaps I can check that rxr remains stable unless a read operation completes. Wait, but rxr is read-only, so it should only change when the core writes to it internally after a read.\n\nFor functionality, after a read operation (when RD bit in cr is set), once the transfer completes (TIP goes low and IF goes high), rxr should hold the received data. But without knowing the exact data, maybe we can check that rxr is not X or Z during valid times. Also, when a read is initiated, after completion, rxr should be updated. But how to model that without knowing the exact data? Maybe check that when a read is done, rxr changes from its previous value. But that might not be reliable if the same data is received again. Alternatively, since the DataIO Shift Register transfers to rxr, perhaps when the shift register is full, it's copied to rxr. But again, without the shift register signal, it's tricky.\n\nAnother angle: when the status register's IF bit is set (sr[0] == 1) and the operation was a read (RD was set in cr), then rxr should have valid data. But how to track that RD was set? Since the RD bit is cleared automatically, maybe we need to check that after a read command (when cr[2] is set), once IF is high, rxr is updated. But the RD bit is cleared by the time IF is set, so maybe we need to look at the command history. That complicates things. Alternatively, when the core is in a read state, and the transfer completes, rxr gets the data. But without internal state signals, this is hard.\n\nWait, the status register has a TIP bit (sr[3]). When TIP goes from high to low, and IF goes high, that indicates a transfer completion. If the last command was a read (RD was set), then rxr should have new data. But since RD is auto-cleared, maybe we can't directly check that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, whenever the IF bit is set (interrupt flag), and the transfer was a read, rxr should have the received data. But how to determine if it was a read? Maybe by the fact that the RD bit was set in the command register before the transfer started. But since the RD bit is cleared automatically, we need to check that the RD was set in the previous cycle. But that might not be feasible in assertions without tracking past states.\n\nAlternatively, since rxr is read-only, any write to its address (0x03) from the WISHBONE interface should not change its value. So an assertion that when wb_adr_i is 0x03 and wb_we_i is high (write), then rxr remains unchanged. Because rxr is read-only, writes should not affect it.\n\nAlso, after reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), rxr should be 0x00. That's a reset check.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check rxr is 8 bits.\n\nConnectivity: Check that writes to rxr's address don't change it. Also, after reset, it's 0x00.\n\nFunctionality: When a read operation completes (TIP goes low, IF goes high), rxr is updated. But without the shift register, maybe check that rxr is stable unless a read completes. Or when a read is acknowledged (IF high), rxr is not X.\n\nAlso, during a read transfer (when RD is set), the rxr should capture the data once the transfer is done. But again, without internal signals, this is challenging.\n\nAnother point: The rxr should only change when a read operation has completed. So between transfers, it should remain stable unless a new read is done. So maybe an assertion that rxr remains the same unless there's a transfer completion (IF going high) following a read command.\n\nBut how to track that the transfer was a read? Since the RD bit is cleared automatically, perhaps when the RD bit was set in the command register, and then TIP goes low and IF goes high, rxr should have new data. But this requires checking past values of the command register.\n\nAlternatively, use a sequence that captures when RD is set, and then check that after TIP falls and IF rises, rxr changes. But this might require a property that spans multiple cycles.\n\nAlternatively, since the DataIO Shift Register transfers to rxr when a byte is received, maybe when the shift register is done (some internal signal), rxr is updated. But without that signal, it's not possible.\n\nGiven the limitations, perhaps focus on what's observable:\n\n1. Width: rxr is 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity: Writes to rxr's address don't affect it; reads return the value.\n3. Reset value is 0x00.\n4. After a read transfer completes (IF set, TIP low), rxr is updated (but how to check the value? Maybe just that it's not X, or that it changes from previous value if a read occurred).\n\nAlso, since rxr is read-only, any write from WISHBONE to its address should not modify it. So an assertion that when wb_adr_i is 0x03 (rxr's address) and wb_we_i is high, then rxr remains the same before and after the write.\n\nAnother functionality point: When a read is performed (RD bit set in cr), after the transfer completes, the received data is in rxr. But without knowing the exact data, maybe check that rxr is stable until the next read completion.\n\nSo possible SVAs:\n\n- Width: assert property ($bits(rxr) == 8);\n- Connectivity: Writes to rxr's address don't change rxr.\n- Reset: After reset, rxr is 0x00.\n- Functionality: When a read transfer completes (IF goes high, TIP goes low), rxr is updated (but how? Maybe check that it's not equal to its previous value if a read was issued, but this could be flaky. Alternatively, use a sequence where after RD is set, eventually rxr changes. But this might be complex.)\n\nAlso, check that rxr is not X or Z during normal operation.\n\nBut considering the available signals, perhaps the following:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. Reset value check.\n3. Write protection: Writes to rxr's address don't change it.\n4. After a read command (RD bit set) and transfer completes, rxr is updated. But since RD is auto-cleared, need to capture when RD was set and then check after TIP and IF.\n\nBut how to model that in SVA? Maybe:\n\nproperty p_rxr_update_after_read;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i != !ARST_LVL)\n  $rose(sr[0]) ##0 !sr[3] |-> ##[0:1] $changed(rxr);\nendproperty\nassert property (p_rxr_update_after_read);\n\nBut this assumes that when the interrupt flag rises (transfer done) and TIP is low, rxr changes. However, this could also happen for write operations. So need to check that it's a read operation. But how?\n\nAlternatively, track when a read command was issued. For example, when cr[2] (RD) is set, then after the transfer completes, rxr should have new data. But since RD is cleared automatically, we need to check that RD was set in the previous cycle before the transfer starts.\n\nThis might require a sequence that captures the setting of RD and then waits for TIP to go high and then low, and IF to go high.\n\nBut this could be complex. Maybe:\n\nsequence s_read_cmd;\n  (wb_adr_i == 3 && wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && (wb_dat_i[2] == 1)) ##1 (cr[2] == 1);\nendsequence\n\nBut the command register cr is written when wb_we_i is high, address is for cr (0x04), etc. Wait, the command register is at address 0x04. So when the CPU writes to the command register (address 0x04) with the RD bit set (bit 2), that initiates a read.\n\nSo the sequence would be: writing to CR (address 0x04) with RD bit set, then TIP goes high, then TIP goes low and IF goes high, then rxr should have new data.\n\nBut modeling this in SVA requires tracking the write to CR and then the subsequent transfer.\n\nBut this might be too involved. Alternatively, whenever a read operation is completed (as indicated by IF and TIP), rxr should have been updated. However, for writes, the rxr wouldn't change. So perhaps the assertion should only check that after a read completes, rxr is updated. But how to distinguish read and write completions?\n\nThe status register's RxACK bit (sr[7]) indicates if the slave acknowledged, but that's not directly indicating read vs write. The command register's RD and WR bits are cleared after the command, so they can't be checked at completion time.\n\nThis is a challenge. Maybe the best approach is to assume that any transfer completion (IF high, TIP low) that was preceded by a read command (RD bit set in CR) should result in rxr being updated. But without tracking the command history, this is difficult.\n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps focus on the connectivity and reset checks, and the functionality that rxr is stable unless a transfer completes, but that's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, since rxr is updated when the DataIO Shift Register transfers data to it, which happens after a read operation, perhaps when the shift register is full (after 8 bits), but again, without the shift register signal, this can't be checked.\n\nIn conclusion, the feasible SVAs are:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. Reset value check.\n3. Write protection: writes to rxr's address don't change it.\n4. After reset, rxr is 0.\n5. When a read transfer completes (IF set, TIP low), rxr is not X.\n\nBut the exact functionality assertion is tricky without internal signals. Maybe the connectivity and reset checks are the main ones possible with the given info.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: Verify rxr is 8 bits using $bits.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - Writes to rxr's address (0x03) shouldn't modify rxr (read-only).\n   - Reset initializes rxr to 0x00.\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - After a read transfer completes (TIP=0, IF=1), rxr updates with valid data.\n   - rxr remains stable unless a new read completes.\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check on signal width.\n- **Connectivity**: Ensure no writes affect rxr and reset value.\n- **Functionality**: Monitor rxr stability and update post-read.\n\n[Answer]\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(rxr) == 8);\n\n// Connectivity: Writes to rxr's address don't affect it\nproperty p_rxr_write_protect;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i != !ARST_LVL)\n  (wb_adr_i == 3 && wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> (rxr == $past(rxr));\nendproperty\nassert property (p_rxr_write_protect);\n\n// Reset value check\nproperty p_rxr_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == !ARST_LVL)\n  (wb_rst_i) |=> (rxr == 8'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (p_rxr_reset);\n\n// Functionality: rxr updates after read completion\nproperty p_rxr_update_after_read;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i != !ARST_LVL)\n  $rose(sr[0]) && !sr[3] |=> !$stable(rxr);\nendproperty\nassert property (p_rxr_update_after_read);\n```"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Generate SVAs for rxr. \n[Signal name]: rxr\n[Description]:\n    [Definition]: 8-bit wide, read-only register located at address 0x03 that holds the last byte received via I2C.\n    [Functionality]: Stores the byte received from the I2C bus after a read operation.

Maybe:\n\nproperty p_rxr_update_after_read;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i != !ARST_LVL)\n  $rose(sr[0]) ##0 !sr[3] |-> ##[0:1] $changed(rxr);\nendproperty\nassert property (p_rxr_update_after_read);\n\nBut this assumes that when the interrupt flag rises (transfer done) and TIP is low, rxr changes. However, this could also happen for write operations. So need to check that it's a read operation. But how?\n\nAlternatively, track when a read command was issued. For example, when cr[2] (RD) is set, then after the transfer completes, rxr should have new data. But since RD is cleared automatically, we need to check that RD was set in the previous cycle before the transfer starts.\n\nThis might require a sequence that captures the setting of RD and then waits for TIP to go high and then low, and IF to go high.\n\nBut this could be complex. Maybe:\n\nsequence s_read_cmd;\n  (wb_adr_i == 3 && wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && (wb_dat_i[2] == 1)) ##1 (cr[2] == 1);\nendsequence\n\nBut the command register cr is written when wb_we_i is high, address is for cr (0x04), etc. Wait, the command register is at address 0x04. So when the CPU writes to the command register (address 0x04) with the RD bit set (bit 2), that initiates a read.\n\nSo the sequence would be: writing to CR (address 0x04) with RD bit set, then TIP goes high, then TIP goes low and IF goes high, then rxr should have new data.\n\nBut modeling this in SVA requires tracking the write to CR and then the subsequent transfer.\n\nBut this might be too involved. Alternatively, whenever a read operation is completed (as indicated by IF and TIP), rxr should have been updated. However, for writes, the rxr wouldn't change. So perhaps the assertion should only check that after a read completes, rxr is updated. But how to distinguish read and write completions?\n\nThe status register's RxACK bit (sr[7]) indicates if the slave acknowledged, but that's not directly indicating read vs write. The command register's RD and WR bits are cleared after the command, so they can't be checked at completion time.\n\nThis is a challenge. Maybe the best approach is to assume that any transfer completion (IF high, TIP low) that was preceded by a read command (RD bit set in CR) should result in rxr being updated. But without tracking the command history, this is difficult.\n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps focus on the connectivity and reset checks, and the functionality that rxr is stable unless a transfer completes, but that's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, since rxr is updated when the DataIO Shift Register transfers data to it, which happens after a read operation, perhaps when the shift register is full (after 8 bits), but again, without the shift register signal, this can't be checked.\n\nIn conclusion, the feasible SVAs are:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. Reset value check.\n3. Write protection: writes to rxr's address don't change it.\n4. After reset, rxr is 0.\n5. When a read transfer completes (IF set, TIP low), rxr is not X.\n\nBut the exact functionality assertion is tricky without internal signals.

LLM Output: <think>

Alright, let's break down the analysis of the provided SVAs for the `rxr` signal step by step, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, and potential issues like clock cycle misinterpretations or complex conditions.

### **1. Width Assertion**
```systemverilog
assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(rxr) == 8);
```
**Feedback**:
- **Correctness**: Correct. Ensures `rxr` is 8 bits wide as per the spec.
- **Consistency**: Aligns with the spec’s definition of `rxr` as an 8-bit register.
- **Completeness**: Good. No issues here.
- **Score**: +10 (No flaws).

---

### **2. Connectivity: Write Protection**
```systemverilog
property p_rxr_write_protect;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i != !ARST_LVL)
  (wb_adr_i == 3 && wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> (rxr == $past(rxr));
endproperty
assert property (p_rxr_write_protect);
```
**Feedback**:
- **Correctness**: Partially correct. The property checks that writes to address `0x03` (where `rxr` is mapped) do not modify `rxr`. However:
  - **Flaw 1**: The spec states that `rxr` is read-only, but the assertion only checks writes to address `0x03`. The `rxr` is part of a shared address with `txr` (address `0x03` for writes, `0x03` for reads). The assertion should explicitly check that writes to `txr` (address `0x03` with `wb_we_i=1`) do not affect `rxr`. However, the current assertion is redundant because `rxr` is read-only and not connected to the WISHBONE write path. A better approach would be to check that `rxr` is never updated during a write transaction (not just at address `0x03`).
  - **Flaw 2**: The disable condition `arst_i != !ARST_LVL` is incorrect. The spec defines `arst_i` as asynchronous reset with level `ARST_LVL`. The correct disable condition should be `arst_i == ARST_LVL` (active when reset is asserted).
- **Consistency**: Inconsistent with the spec’s reset polarity.
- **Completeness**: Misses cases where other addresses might erroneously write to `rxr`.
- **Score**: -20 (Flaws in disable condition and scope).

---

### **3. Reset Value Check**
```systemverilog
property p_rxr_reset;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == !ARST_LVL)
  (wb_rst_i) |=> (rxr == 8'h00);
endproperty
assert property (p_rxr_reset);
```
**Feedback**:
- **Correctness**: Incorrect. The spec states `rxr` resets to `0x00`, but:
  - **Flaw 1**: The disable condition `arst_i == !ARST_LVL` is inverted. If `ARST_LVL` is the active level (e.g., `ARST_LVL=0` for active-low), the disable should be `arst_i == ARST_LVL` (e.g., `arst_i=0` when active-low). The current condition disables the assertion during active reset, which is wrong.
  - **Flaw 2**: The property only checks synchronous reset (`wb_rst_i`). It does not check asynchronous reset (`arst_i`), which is explicitly mentioned in the spec.
- **Consistency**: Fails to handle asynchronous reset as per the spec.
- **Completeness**: Misses asynchronous reset cases.
- **Score**: -30 (Critical flaws in reset handling).

### **4. Functionality: Update After Read Completion**
```systemverilog
property p_rxr_update_after_read;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i != !ARST_LVL)
  $rose(sr[0]) && !sr[3] |=> !$stable(rxr);
endproperty
assert property (p_rxr_update_after_read);
```
**Feedback**:
- **Correctness**: Partially correct. The intent is to check that `rxr` updates after a read completes (when `sr[0]` (IF) rises and `sr[3]` (TIP) is low). However:
  - **Flaw 1**: The condition `$rose(sr[0]) && !sr[3]` does not distinguish between read and write operations. The `rxr` should only update after a **read** operation, but this assertion triggers on any transfer completion (including writes). For example, after a write operation completes, `sr[0]` rises and `sr[3]` falls, but `rxr` should not update.
  - **Flaw 2**: The assertion uses `!$stable(rxr)`, which fails if the same data is received consecutively (e.g., two reads of `0xAA`). This is a false negative.
  - **Flaw 3**: The disable condition again uses `arst_i != !ARST_LVL`, which is incorrect (as in previous properties).
- **Consistency**: Fails to isolate read operations.
- **Completeness**: Does not account for identical consecutive reads.
- **Score**: -40 (Major logic errors and false negatives).

---

### **Additional Flaws**
1. **Clock Cycle Misinterpretations**:
   - The properties use `|=>` (next cycle), but the spec does not specify the exact cycle when `rxr` updates. It might update in the same cycle as `sr[0]` rises, leading to potential mismatches.
2. **Nested Conditions**:
   - The use of `wb_rst_i || arst_i != !ARST_LVL` in disable conditions is error-prone and unclear. It should be simplified to `arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i` to cover both reset types.
3. **Lack of Read/Write Discrimination**:
   - No properties ensure `rxr` updates **only** after read operations. This is a critical omission.

---

### **Final Score**
- **Width Assertion**: +10
- **Write Protection**: -20
- **Reset Check**: -30
- **Functionality**: -40
- **Total**: **-80/100**

---

### **Recommendations**
1. **Reset Handling**:
   - Fix disable conditions to `arst_i == ARST_LVL`.
   - Add assertions for asynchronous reset (`arst_i`).
2. **Read/Write Discrimination**:
   - Track the `cr[2]` (RD bit) to ensure updates only occur after read operations.
3. **Stability Check**:
   - Replace `!$stable(rxr)` with a check against the DataIO Shift Register (if possible) or allow stability if the same data is received.
4. **Clock Cycle Alignment**:
   - Use overlapping implications (`|->` instead of `|=>`) for same-cycle updates.
