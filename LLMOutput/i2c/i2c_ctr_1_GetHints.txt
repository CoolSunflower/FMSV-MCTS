It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the \'ctr\' signal, which is the Control Register. Let\'s start by understanding the specifications provided.\n\nFirst, the \'ctr\' is an 8-bit read/write register. The key bits are EN (bit 7) and IEN (bit 6), with bits 5:0 reserved. The reset value is 0x00. The core only processes commands when EN is set. Also, reserved bits must be written as zeros.\n\nFor the SVAs, I need to cover width, connectivity, and functionality.\n\nWidth: The register is 8 bits, so check that $bits(ctr) is 8.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that when the WISHBONE interface writes to address 0x02, the ctr register updates correctly. Also, check that reserved bits remain zero when written.\n\nFunctionality: Verify that EN and IEN bits function as intended. For example, when EN is 0, the core shouldn\'t process commands. Also, reserved bits should read as zero.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check ctr is 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity: On a write to address 0x02, ctr gets the correct data, with reserved bits masked to zero.\n3. Functionality: Reserved bits are always read as zero. EN and IEN can be set/cleared, and reserved bits can\'t be written to 1.\n\nWait, but how to handle writes? Since reserved bits must be written as zero, any write to those bits should be ignored or forced to zero. So when writing, the reserved bits (5:0) should be masked, ensuring they remain zero regardless of what\'s written.\n\nAlso, after reset, ctr should be 0x00.\n\nSo, assertions would include:\n\n- After reset, ctr == 8\'h00.\n- When writing to ctr\'s address, the reserved bits are masked to zero.\n- Reads of ctr always have reserved bits as zero.\n- EN and IEN can be toggled, but reserved bits can\'t.\n\nBut the user mentioned not to create new signals, so I need to use existing ones like wb_adr_i, wb_dat_i, etc.\n\nAlso, need to consider the WISHBONE interface timing. Since each access takes 2 cycles, maybe check that after a write, the ctr updates on the next posedge.\n\nBut the exact timing might depend on the implementation. The spec says all outputs are registered, so writes likely take effect on the next clock edge after the WB cycle completes.\n\nHmm, but the user wants SVAs based on the given signals. So for connectivity, when a write occurs to address 0x02, then ctr should update with the data, but with reserved bits forced to zero.\n\nSo, when wb_we_i is high, wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, and wb_adr_i is 0x02, then on the next clock, ctr should be (wb_dat_i & 8\'hC0) because bits 5:0 are masked.\n\nAlso, when reading ctr, the reserved bits should be zero. So any read from address 0x02 should return ctr[7:6] in bits 7:6 and zeros elsewhere.\n\nBut how to model that in SVA? Maybe check that when a read occurs, the data on wb_dat_o has bits 5:0 as zero.\n\nAdditionally, after reset, ctr should be zero.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check ctr is 8 bits.\n\nConnectivity: On a valid write to ctr\'s address, ctr updates with data & 8\'hC0.\n\nFunctionality: Reserved bits (5:0) are always zero when read. EN and IEN can be set, but reserved bits can\'t. Also, after reset, ctr is zero.\n\nAlso, need to check that when EN is 0, the core doesn\'t accept commands. But that might involve other signals like CR or SR, which could be more complex. Maybe that\'s part of the functionality SVA for ctr.\n\nWait, the functionality of EN being 0 preventing command processing is part of the core\'s operation, but how to check that? It would require monitoring the command register and ensuring that when EN is 0, commands aren\'t processed. But since the SVA is for ctr, maybe focus on the EN bit\'s effect on the core\'s ability to process commands. However, that might require checking interactions with other modules, which could be beyond the scope of just ctr\'s SVAs. The user asked for SVAs specific to the current signal, so maybe stick to the properties of ctr itself.\n\nSo, the main functionality checks for ctr are:\n\n- EN and IEN can be written and read correctly.\n- Reserved bits are always zero when read.\n- Writes to reserved bits are ignored (masked to zero).\n\nAlso, after reset, the register is zero.\n\nPutting all this into SVAs:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(ctr) == 8);\n\n2. Connectivity: When a write happens to address 0x02, ctr is updated with (wb_dat_i & 8\'hC0) on the next clock.\n\n3. Functionality:\n   a. Reserved bits are always zero when read.\n   b. After reset, ctr is zero.\n   c. Writes to reserved bits are masked.\n\nBut how to model the write? The WISHBONE interface has wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, and wb_adr_i. A write occurs when wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, and wb_cyc_i are all high, and the address is correct.\n\nSo, for the connectivity assertion:\n\nproperty ctr_write;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && (wb_adr_i == 2\'h02)) |=> (ctr == (wb_dat_i & 8\'hC0));\nendproperty\nassert property (ctr_write);\n\nFor functionality, reserved bits read as zero:\n\nproperty ctr_reserved_read;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (ctr[5:0] == 6\'b0);\nendproperty\nassert property (ctr_reserved_read);\n\nAlso, after reset, ctr should be zero:\n\nproperty ctr_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) $rose(wb_rst_i) |=> (ctr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (ctr_reset);\n\nWait, but the reset could be asynchronous (arst_i) or synchronous (wb_rst_i). The spec mentions ARST_LVL parameter, but the user\'s mapping includes both wb_rst_i and arst_i. However, the SVA should use the appropriate reset. Since the core can use either, but the SVAs are for the current signal (ctr), which is part of the WISHBONE interface, perhaps the synchronous reset wb_rst_i is used here. But the spec says arst_i is for FPGA implementations. The problem states to use the given signals, so maybe check both resets? But the user\'s answer might need to handle asynchronous reset.\n\nBut the spec says ARST_LVL is a parameter that defines the async reset level. So, if arst_i is active, it should reset ctr. However, the user\'s mapping includes wb_rst_i as the synchronous reset. The core can use either, but the SVA should account for both? Hmm, this might complicate things. The user\'s answer should use the signals provided. Since arst_i is an input, maybe include it in the reset condition.\n\nBut the problem says "Do not generate any new signals." So, the SVAs should use the existing reset signals. The ctr register is part of the WISHBONE interface, which uses wb_rst_i as the synchronous reset. However, the core also has arst_i for asynchronous reset. So, the SVAs should check that when either reset is active, ctr is reset.\n\nBut how to model that? The spec says ARST_LVL is the async reset level. So, if ARST_LVL is 0, then arst_i active low. So, the reset condition is (arst_i == !ARST_LVL). But since the parameter is not a signal, maybe use a localparam to define ARST_LVL. However, the user says parameters are already added, so we can use a localparam.\n\nWait, the user instruction says: "Parameters are already added in code so you don\'t need to generate them. The only parameters you can add are localparam." So, we can define a localparam for ARST_LVL.\n\nBut the default is 0. So, the async reset is active low. So, the reset condition for async would be (arst_i == 1\'b0) if ARST_LVL is 0.\n\nBut since the actual value of ARST_LVL is a parameter, we can write:\n\nlocalparam ARST_LVL = 1\'b0; // Assuming default value\n\nThen, the async reset is triggered when arst_i == ARST_LVL.\n\nBut in SVAs, we can\'t directly use parameters unless they are defined. So, including a localparam in the assertions.\n\nBut the user says to put the final assertions between systemverilog tags, and parameters are already present. So, perhaps the SVA for async reset would be:\n\nproperty ctr_async_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) $fell(arst_i) |=> (ctr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (ctr_async_reset);\n\nBut this depends on ARST_LVL. If ARST_LVL is 1, then the async reset is active high, so $rose(arst_i). To handle both cases, maybe use:\n\nproperty ctr_async_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == !ARST_LVL) |=> (ctr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\n\nBut this might not be synthesizable. Alternatively, use the localparam to define the active level.\n\nBut the user might not want to handle that complexity. Since the exact reset handling depends on the parameter, but the SVA needs to be generic. Alternatively, check both synchronous and asynchronous resets.\n\nBut the problem states to use the given signals. The ctr is part of the WISHBONE interface, which uses wb_rst_i as the synchronous reset. However, the core can also use arst_i. So, the SVAs should check that when either reset is active, the ctr is reset.\n\nBut this might be complicated. The spec says that arst_i is for FPGA implementations and can be used instead of wb_rst_i. So, perhaps the core uses either one, but not both. However, the SVA should check both possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem states to generate SVAs based on the given signals, and the resets are part of the inputs, the SVAs should check that when either reset is asserted, the ctr is reset.\n\nBut how to model that? For example:\n\n// Synchronous reset\nproperty ctr_sync_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_rst_i |=> (ctr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (ctr_sync_reset);\n\n// Asynchronous reset\nproperty ctr_async_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) $fell(arst_i) |=> (ctr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (ctr_async_reset);\n\nBut this depends on the ARST_LVL parameter. If ARST_LVL is 1, then the async reset is active high, so $rose(arst_i) instead.\n\nTo make it parameterized, perhaps use a localparam:\n\nlocalparam ARST_LVL = 1\'b0; // Default value\n\nproperty ctr_async_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL) |=> (ctr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (ctr_async_reset);\n\nBut this might not work as |=> checks the next cycle, but async reset is immediate. So, maybe use:\n\nproperty ctr_async_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) $past(arst_i == ARST_LVL, 1) |-> (ctr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe the user expects to check that after reset (sync or async), ctr is zero. However, given the time constraints, perhaps focus on the synchronous reset wb_rst_i as per WISHBONE, and also check async reset if possible.\n\nBut the problem states to not create new signals, so maybe include both resets.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect to handle only the synchronous reset since the WISHBONE interface uses wb_rst_i. The async reset arst_i is an alternative, but perhaps the SVAs should check both.\n\nBut this could be beyond the scope. The user\'s answer might need to include both.\n\nPutting it all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width assertion.\n2. Connectivity: Write to ctr address updates the register with reserved bits masked.\n3. Functionality: Reserved bits read as zero.\n4. Reset conditions: Both sync and async resets set ctr to zero.\n\nBut the user might not want to handle async reset due to complexity. Alternatively, the problem might expect to handle only the synchronous reset.\n\nAnother point: When the core is disabled (EN=0), it should not accept new commands. But how to check that? That would involve the Command Register (CR) and Status Register (SR), which might be outside the scope of ctr\'s SVAs. Since the question is about ctr, maybe focus on the properties of ctr itself, not its interaction with other registers.\n\nSo, the final SVAs are:\n\n- Width check.\n- Write connectivity with reserved bits masked.\n- Reserved bits always read as zero.\n- Reset value after sync and async reset.\n\nBut the async reset part might be tricky. Let me proceed with the SVAs as follows.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: `ctr` is an 8-bit register. Use `$bits` to verify.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - On valid WISHBONE write to address 0x02, `ctr` updates with `wb_dat_i` masked to clear reserved bits (5:0).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - Reserved bits (5:0) must always read as 0.\n   - After reset (sync or async), `ctr` is 0x00.\n   - EN (bit 7) and IEN (bit 6) can be modified, but reserved bits remain 0.\n4. **Reset Handling**:\n   - Check both synchronous (`wb_rst_i`) and asynchronous (`arst_i`) resets.\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check using `$bits`.\n- **Write Propagation**: Capture writes to `ctr` and ensure reserved bits are masked.\n- **Reserved Bits**: Always read as 0.\n- **Reset**: Ensure `ctr` initializes to 0x00 after reset.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(ctr) == 8);\n\n// Connectivity: Write to CTR address updates EN/IEN, masks reserved bits\nproperty p_ctr_write;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || (arst_i != ARST_LVL))\n  (wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && (wb_adr_i == 2\'h02)) |=> (ctr == (wb_dat_i & 8\'hC0));\nendproperty\nassert property (p_ctr_write);\n\n// Functionality: Reserved bits (5:0) always read as 0\nproperty p_ctr_reserved_zero;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || (arst_i != ARST_LVL))\n  (ctr[5:0] == 6\'h0);\nendproperty\nassert property (p_ctr_reserved_zero);\n\n// Reset: CTR is 0x00 after synchronous or asynchronous reset\nproperty p_ctr_reset_sync;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) $rose(wb_rst_i) |=> (ctr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (p_ctr_reset_sync);\n\nproperty p_ctr_reset_async;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) $changed(arst_i) && (arst_i == ARST_LVL) |=> (ctr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (p_ctr_reset_async);\n```'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the control register block based on the provided specifications. First, I need to understand the interface and requirements from the given information.\n\nThe control register block has inputs like opcode (read/write), address, data, security code, and bit mask. Outputs include data_out and an error flag. The main functionality is to handle read/write operations with security checks and proper data handling.\n\nFrom Figure 7.6, the key signals are:\n- opcode (read/write)\n- address\n- data_in\n- security_code\n- bit_mask\n- data_out\n- error_flag\n\nThe SVAs need to cover width, connectivity, and functionality. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Width Assertions**:\n   - Check the bit-width of each signal as per the specification. For example, if address is supposed to be 8 bits, ensure that using $bits.\n\n2. **Connectivity Assertions**:\n   - Ensure that when a valid write operation occurs (opcode=write, correct security), the data is written to the specified address, masked by bit_mask.\n   - For reads, data_out should reflect the register content at the address when opcode=read and security is valid.\n\n3. **Functionality Assertions**:\n   - Security checks: If security_code is invalid, error_flag should be asserted, and no write/read should occur.\n   - Bit masking: Only bits enabled by bit_mask are written; others remain unchanged.\n   - Error conditions: Illegal access attempts (wrong security, invalid opcode) trigger error_flag.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned a sample system with signals like hsize, hburst, etc., but the main focus is on the control register block. The examples given (hsize, hburst) might relate to other parts, but the user wants SVAs specifically for the control registers as per Figure 7.6.\n\nThe specification mentions that the control register block uses a security code to authorize access. So, any read/write without proper security should result in an error.

The user wants me to generate SVAs for the control register block based on the provided specifications. First, I need to understand the interface and requirements from the given information.\n\nThe control register block has inputs like opcode (read/write), address, data, security code, and bit mask. Outputs include data_out and an error flag. The main functionality is to handle read/write operations with security checks and proper data handling.\n\nFrom Figure 7.6, the key signals are:\n- opcode (read/write)\n- address\n- data_in\n- security_code\n- bit_mask\n- data_out\n- error_flag\n\nThe SVAs need to cover width, connectivity, and functionality. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Width Assertions**:\n   - Check the bit-width of each signal as per the specification. For example, if address is supposed to be 8 bits, ensure that using $bits.\n\n2. **Connectivity Assertions**:\n   - Ensure that when a valid write operation occurs (opcode=write, correct security), the data is written to the specified address, masked by bit_mask.\n   - For reads, data_out should reflect the register content at the address when opcode=read and security is valid.\n\n3. **Functionality Assertions**:\n   - Security checks: If security_code is invalid, error_flag should be asserted, and no write/read should occur.\n   - Bit masking: Only bits enabled by bit_mask are written; others remain unchanged.\n   - Error conditions: Illegal access attempts (wrong security, invalid opcode) trigger error_flag.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned a sample system with signals like hsize, hburst, etc., but the main focus is on the control register block. The examples given (hsize, hburst) might relate to other parts, but the user wants SVAs specifically for the control registers as per Figure 7.6.\n\nThe specification mentions that the control register block uses a security code to authorize access. So, any read/write without proper security should result in an error. Also, bit_mask determines which bits of the register are written.\n\nPossible SVAs:\n\n**Width Checks**:\n- opcode is 1 bit (read or write).\n- address width (e.g., 8 bits).\n- data_in and data_out width (e.g., 32 bits).\n- security_code width (e.g., 4 bits).\n- bit_mask width (same as data_in, e.g., 32 bits).\n- error_flag is 1 bit.\n\n**Connectivity**:\n- On valid write (opcode=write, security valid), data_in is written to the register at address, masked by bit_mask.\n- On valid read (opcode=read, security valid), data_out reflects the register content at address.\n\n**Functionality**:\n- If security_code is invalid, error_flag is asserted, and no write occurs.\n- Writes only affect bits set in bit_mask.\n- Reads with invalid security do not update data_out and assert error_flag.\n- Illegal opcodes (not read/write) trigger error_flag.\n\nBut the exact signal names and widths aren't specified in the problem.

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, let's take a deep dive into analyzing the provided SVAs for the control register block. The goal is to identify every possible flaw, inconsistency, or incompleteness based on the original specifications and best practices in SVA design.

**1. Width Assertions:**
- **Flaw 1:** The assertions check signal widths but don't verify that the `registers` array elements are 32 bits. If the registers are part of the design, their width should be confirmed.
- **Flaw 2:** The `reset` signal's width isn't checked. While it's common for reset to be 1-bit, if the spec defines it differently, this could be a miss.
- **Flaw 3:** No check for the `registers` array's address width. The address is 8 bits, so the array should have 256 entries. An assertion like `assert property (registers.size() == 256);` is missing.

**2. Connectivity Assertions:**
- **Flaw 4:** The `p_write_connectivity` property uses `##1` to check the next cycle, but if the design has a variable latency (e.g., due to pipelining), this could fail. The spec doesn't clarify timing, making this assumption risky.
- **Flaw 5:** The `p_read_connectivity` property assumes data_out updates in the next cycle. If the design has a read latency longer than one cycle, this assertion would incorrectly fail.
- **Flaw 6:** Both properties use `!error_flag` in the antecedent. However, if an error occurs during the operation (e.g., security check fails mid-transaction), the consequent might not hold, but the assertion isn't structured to handle such cases.

**3. Functionality Assertions:**
- **Flaw 7:** The `p_security_error` property triggers on any invalid security code during read/write. However, the spec might require the error_flag to persist until explicitly cleared. The assertion doesn't check if the error_flag remains asserted beyond the cycle.
- **Flaw 8:** The `p_write_mask_integrity` property checks that unmasked bits remain unchanged but doesn't verify that masked bits are correctly updated. It should also assert that `(registers[address] & bit_mask) == (data_in & bit_mask)`.
- **Flaw 9:** The `p_invalid_opcode_error` doesn't account for opcodes beyond read/write. If the spec defines specific opcodes (e.g., 2'b00 for read, 2'b01 for write), using `inside {READ, WRITE}` might miss undefined opcodes if the opcode width is larger than 1 bit.
- **Flaw 10:** No assertion checks that reserved bits (if any) in the control register are not modified. For example, if certain bits in the register are reserved, writes to those bits should be ignored or cause an error.

**4. Reset and Initialization:**
- **Flaw 11:** No assertions verify the initial state after reset. For example, registers should initialize to their default values (e.g., all zeros) upon reset.
- **Flaw 12:** The reset condition (`disable iff (reset)`) is used, but there's no check that during reset, all operations are ignored, and registers remain unchanged.

**5. Completeness:**
- **Flaw 13:** Missing assertions for read/write collisions. If a write and read to the same address occur simultaneously, the behavior isn't specified or checked.
- **Flaw 14:** No coverage for error_flag persistence. Once asserted, the error_flag might need a specific action (e.g., reset or clear command) to deassert, which isn't covered.
- **Flaw 15:** The spec mentions bit masking, but there's no check that the bit_mask is applied correctly during writes. For example, if bit_mask is all zeros, the register should remain unchanged.

**6. Clock and Reset Edge Cases:**
- **Flaw 16:** The properties use `posedge clk` but don't consider asynchronous reset (`arst_i` in the original spec). If the design has an asynchronous reset, assertions should account for its effect immediately, not just synchronous resets.
- **Flaw 17:** No assertions check for metastability or glitch resistance, though this might be beyond the scope of SVAs.

**7. Signal Correlations:**
- **Flaw 18:** The `error_flag` is checked in isolation. There's no correlation between error_flag and actual erroneous operations (e.g., data_out shouldn't update on error).
- **Flaw 19:** If a security error occurs, the spec might require that no write/read occurs. The current assertions check for error_flag but don't ensure that the register isn't modified or data_out remains unchanged.

**8. Spec Compliance:**
- **Flaw 20:** The original spec for the I2C control register (ctr) mentions reserved bits (5:0) must be written as zeros. The provided SVAs don't include checks for these reserved bits, allowing them to be written improperly.
- **Flaw 21:** The EN and IEN bits in the control register have specific behaviors (e.g., EN must be cleared only when no transfer is in progress). The current SVAs don't model these state-dependent constraints.

**9. Practical Scenarios:**
- **Flaw 22:** No assertions for multi-cycle operations or pipelined accesses. If the design allows back-to-back reads/writes, the SVAs don't ensure correct handling.
- **Flaw 23:** The bit_mask is applied as a bitwise AND, but if the design uses a different masking strategy (e.g., additive), the assertions would be incorrect.

**10. Syntax and Best Practices:**
- **Flaw 24:** Using `##1` assumes single-cycle latency. If the design has variable latency, this could lead to false failures. Using `s_eventually` or specifying exact timing based on the spec would be better.
- **Flaw 25:** The properties use hard-coded values (e.g., `4'hF` for VALID_SECURITY). These should be replaced with parameters or defines for maintainability.
- **Flaw 26:** The `registers` array is referenced directly, which might not be accessible in a real design without hierarchical paths, leading to simulation vs. synthesis mismatches.

**Conclusion:**
The provided SVAs cover basic scenarios but lack depth in handling spec-specific details, edge cases, and some functional requirements. Key misses include reserved bit checks, reset behavior, error handling beyond flag assertion, and precise timing assumptions. Addressing these would improve correctness and completeness.

**2. Connectivity Assertions (Score: -30)**  
- **Flaw:** Assumes fixed 1-cycle latency for writes/reads.  
  **Impact:** Fails in designs with variable latency.  
  **Fix:** Use `s_eventually` or align with spec-defined timing.  
- **Flaw:** No check for data_out stability during errors.  
  **Impact:** Allows corrupted data_out on security errors.  
  **Fix:** Add `(error_flag) |=> stable(data_out);`.

**3. Functionality Assertions (Score: -40)**

- **Flaw:** No reset-state checks for registers/error_flag.  
  **Impact:** Undetected initialization bugs.  
  **Fix:** Add `assert property (reset |-> registers == 0 && error_flag == 0);`.

**5. Completeness (Score: -35)**  
- **Flaw:** Missing multi-master arbitration checks.  
  **Impact:** Ignores critical I2C protocol requirement.  
  **Fix:** Add assertions for SCL/SDA arbitration as per spec section 4.3.  
- **Flaw:** No coverage for clock stretching.  
  **Impact:** Fails to validate slave-driven SCL low.  
  **Fix:** Assert `scl_pad_oe` behavior during stretching.

**6. Clock/Reset Edge Cases (Score: -15)**  
- **Flaw:** Ignores asynchronous reset (`arst_i`).  
  **Impact:** Fails to check async reset compliance.  
  **Fix:** Add `@(posedge arst_i) assert final (ctr == 0);`.

**7. Spec Compliance (Score: -50)**  
- **Flaw:** EN bit not guarded against mid-transfer disable.  
  **Impact:** Core may hang bus if EN cleared prematurely.  
  **Fix:** `assert property (ctr.EN == 0 |-> !sr.TIP);`.  
- **Flaw:** No check for interrupt generation (IEN vs IF).  
  **Impact:** Undetected interrupt masking bugs.  
  **Fix:** Add `assert property (ctr.IEN && sr.IF |-> wb_inta_o);`.

**Overall Score: -215/100**  
**Key Improvements Needed:**  
1. Add reserved bit protection and EN/IEN state checks.  
2. Model asynchronous reset and initialization.  
3. Verify arbitration, clock stretching, and multi-master scenarios.  
4. Align latency assumptions with spec-defined timing.  
5. Cover interrupt generation and error persistence.  

**Conclusion:** The SVAs lack critical spec-compliance checks and misalign with I2C protocol requirements. A rigorous rewrite focusing on state dependencies, reserved fields, and timing scenarios is essential.
