Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to fix the syntax of the provided SystemVerilog assertions based on the documentation and the error logs from Jasper. The main issues seem to be syntax errors around the 'disable iff' clause and possibly incorrect signal names.

First, looking at the error messages, there's a syntax error near 'disable'. In SystemVerilog, the correct syntax for disabling a property is 'disable iff (condition)'. The user's assertions might have a typo here. Let me check the original assertions.

The original assertions have lines like:
@(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (wb_rst_i))
Wait, the correct syntax should have 'disable iff' after the clocking event. So it should be:
@(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)

Ah, that's the issue. The user missed the closing parenthesis after the clock edge. So the correct line is:
@(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)

Next, the signal names. The documentation mentions sda_padoen_o and scl_padoen_o, but the note says these are renamed to sda_pad_oe and scl_pad_oe in the Verilog code. So all instances of sda_padoen_o in the assertions should be replaced with sda_pad_oe. Similarly for scl_padoen_o.

Looking at the assertions, for example, in the sda_connectivity property, the antecedent uses sda_pad_oe == 1'b0. That seems correct now.

Another thing to check is the use of $fell and $rose. Those functions are correct for detecting edges. Also, the implication operators (|->) and sequence operators like ##1 look okay.

The user also mentioned not to use 'else' constructs, but I don't see any in the provided assertions. So that's fine.

Now, let's go through each assertion one by one and correct the syntax.

For example, the first assertion:

property sda_connectivity;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (wb_rst_i))
  (sda_pad_oe == 1'b0) |-> ##1 (sda_pad_i == sda_pad_o);
endproperty

The clocking event is missing a closing parenthesis. It should be:

property sda_connectivity;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)
  (sda_pad_oe == 1'b0) |-> ##1 (sda_pad_i == sda_pad_o);
endproperty

Wait, the disable iff should be part of the property declaration. So the correct syntax is:

property sda_connectivity;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)
    (sda_pad_oe == 1'b0) |-> ##1 (sda_pad_i == sda_pad_o);
endproperty

But in SystemVerilog, the disable iff comes after the clocking event in the property declaration. So the syntax is correct as above.

Another example: the arbitration_loss property:

property arbitration_loss;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (wb_rst_i))
  (sda_pad_oe == 1'b0 && sda_pad_o == 1'b1 && sda_pad_i == 1'b0) |=> 
  (sr[3] == 1'b1);
endproperty

Again, the clocking event should have the closing parenthesis before disable iff:

@(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)

Same for all other properties. So the main fix is adding the closing parenthesis after the clock edge and ensuring the disable iff is properly placed.

Also, checking signal names like cr[3] and cr[2] which refer to the command register bits. The documentation mentions the Command Register bits STA (bit 3) and STO (bit 2), so those references are correct.

Another potential issue is the use of [0:1] in the throughout clause. Wait, in the sda_stable_during_scl_high property, the line:

$stable(sda_pad_i) throughout [0:1] scl_pad_o[->1]

The syntax for throughout might be incorrect. The correct way to specify a range is with ##[0:1], but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be throughout scl_pad_o[->1], but the original intent was to check stability during the SCL high period. Maybe the sequence needs to be adjusted.

Wait, the user's original assertion might have a syntax error in the sequence. The 'throughout' operator is used as (expression) throughout sequence. So perhaps the correct syntax is:

($stable(sda_pad_i) throughout (##[0:1] scl_pad_o[->1]))

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the user might have intended to check that sda_pad_i is stable from the current cycle until the next occurrence of scl_pad_o rising. Maybe the sequence should be written differently. However, given the time constraints, perhaps the main issue is the clocking event and disable iff syntax.

Given that the Jasper errors point to 'disable' as the issue, fixing the clocking event should resolve those errors. Let's focus on that.

So, for each property, correct the clocking event line to have @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i).

Also, ensure that all instances of sda_padoen_o and scl_padoen_o are replaced with sda_pad_oe and scl_pad_oe, but in the provided assertions, they already use sda_pad_oe, so that's correct.

Another thing: in the sda_stable_during_scl_high property, the antecedent has two implications. Maybe that's causing an issue. Let me check:

The property is written as:
(scl_pad_oe == 1'b0 && $fell(scl_pad_o)) |-> 
(sda_pad_oe == 1'b0 && !(cr[3] || cr[2])) |-> 
($stable(sda_pad_i) throughout [0:1] scl_pad_o[->1]);

But in SystemVerilog, you can't chain |-> like that. Instead, the antecedent should be a conjunction of both conditions. So it should be:

(scl_pad_oe == 1'b0 && $fell(scl_pad_o) && sda_pad_oe == 1'b0 && !(cr[3] || cr[2])) |-> 
($stable(sda_pad_i) throughout ...);

Alternatively, maybe the user intended both conditions as separate antecedents, but that's not correct syntax. So combining them with && would be the right approach.

But the original error logs for this assertion had a syntax error near ':', which might be from the [0:1] part. Wait, in the original error log for sda_stable_during_scl_high, there was an error near ':'. The user had [0:1], which in SystemVerilog should be written as ##[0:1], but in the context of a range, maybe it's different. Alternatively, the throughout clause might need a sequence.

Hmm, perhaps the correct way to write the throughout is:

($stable(sda_pad_i) throughout (##1 scl_pad_o[->1]))

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the user might have intended to check that sda_pad_i is stable from the current cycle until the next occurrence of scl_pad_o. In that case, the sequence would be:

scl_pad_o[->1]

And the assertion is that throughout this sequence, sda_pad_i is stable.

So the correct syntax would be:

($stable(sda_pad_i) throughout (##[0:$] scl_pad_o[->1]))

But the user wrote [0:1], which might not be the right way. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to check stability during the current and next cycle when scl_pad_o rises. This part might require more detailed knowledge of the design.

However, given the Jasper errors, the primary issue is the syntax around 'disable iff' and possibly the sequence operators. Let's first fix the clocking event and disable iff syntax, then check the sequences.

Another thing: the user mentioned not to use 'else' constructs, which aren't present here, so that's fine.

Putting it all together, the corrected assertions would have the clocking event fixed, correct signal names, and proper sequence syntax.
