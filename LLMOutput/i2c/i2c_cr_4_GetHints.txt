It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

The Byte Command Controller tells the Bit Command Controller\nwhich operation has to be performed. For a single byte read, the Bit Command Controller\nreceives 8 separate read commands. Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the Command Register (cr) based on the provided specification. Let me start by understanding the details of the cr signal.\n\nFirst, the cr is an 8-bit write-only register at address 0x04. The bits have specific functions:\n- Bit 7 (STA): Start condition\n- Bit 6 (STO): Stop condition\n- Bit 5 (RD): Read operation\n- Bit 4 (WR): Write operation\n- Bit 3 (ACK): Acknowledge control\n- Bit 0 (IACK): Interrupt acknowledge\nBits 2:1 are reserved and must be written as zeros. Also, the command bits (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK) are auto-cleared after execution and read as zeros. The reset value is 0x00.\n\nNow, considering the types of SVAs required: width, connectivity, function, and any others if needed.\n\nWidth check: The register is 8 bits, so check that $bits(cr) is 8.\n\nConnectivity: Since cr is a write-only register, ensure that writes to it affect the command bits correctly. Also, check that reserved bits are not written as 1. Also, since the command bits auto-clear, after a write, those bits should reset to 0 in the next cycle.\n\nFunction checks:\n- STA and STO cannot be set simultaneously unless in specific cases (like repeated start followed by stop, but according to the spec, the core handles this, so maybe STA and STO should not be set at the same time by software).\n- RD and WR should not be set at the same time.\n- When a command is written (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK), the corresponding action should be taken by the controller.\n- IACK should clear the interrupt flag (sr[0] is IF). So after IACK is set, IF should be cleared.\n- The reserved bits (bits 2:1) should always be written as 0. So any write to cr should have bits 2:1 as 0.\n- After a write to cr, the command bits (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK) should be cleared in the next cycle, since they are auto-cleared.\n\nAlso, since cr is write-only, any read from it should return 0, but the spec says that the command bits are always read as zeros. However, the user can\'t read cr because it\'s write-only. So maybe that\'s handled by the WISHBONE interface, but the SVAs here might not need to check that since we\'re focusing on the cr signal itself.\n\nNow, let\'s structure the assertions.\n\n1. Width assertion: Check that cr is 8 bits wide.\n\n2. Connectivity: Check that reserved bits are written as 0. So whenever there\'s a write to cr, bits 2:1 must be 0.\n\n3. Function: Check that STA and STO are not set at the same time. Similarly, RD and WR should not be set together. Also, after a write, the command bits (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK) should be cleared in the next cycle. Also, when IACK is set, the interrupt flag (sr[0]) should be cleared.\n\nWait, but the IACK bit in cr is set to clear the interrupt. So when IACK is written, the IF bit in sr should be cleared. However, the sr is a status register, and the SVA would need to check that after IACK is set, the IF goes low. But sr is another signal; do we have access to it here? The user mentioned "Do not generate any new signals. Do NOT make any new information that is not provided." So if sr is a related signal, maybe we can reference it.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user says to generate SVAs for the current signal (cr), but related signals can be used if they are provided. Since sr is listed as a related signal, we can use it.\n\nSo, for the IACK function: When cr[0] (IACK) is set, then in the same cycle or next, the sr[0] (IF) should be cleared. But how is the timing? The spec says that writing IACK clears the pending interrupt. So when IACK is written (i.e., when the command register is written with IACK=1), the IF bit should be cleared. Since the command register is write-only, the effect should happen after the write.\n\nBut the exact timing depends on the design. Assuming that when the command is written, the IACK bit is processed in the same cycle, leading to the IF being cleared in the next cycle. Or maybe it\'s combinational. The assertion would need to check that after a write with IACK set, the IF bit becomes 0.\n\nBut since the SVA is for cr, and sr is a related signal, we can write an assertion that when cr[0] is written (i.e., when there\'s a write to cr with IACK=1), then in the next cycle, sr[0] should be 0. However, this depends on the design\'s timing. If the IF is cleared immediately upon writing IACK, then the assertion would check that in the same cycle. But since the WISHBONE interface has a 2-cycle access, maybe the effect is delayed.\n\nThis might be tricky without knowing the exact timing. The spec says that IACK bit is auto-cleared, so when you write IACK=1, it\'s cleared in the next cycle. But the effect on the status register\'s IF bit would need to be checked. However, the user might not have provided enough info, so maybe this assertion is skipped or assumed that the IACK writing leads to IF being cleared.\n\nAlternatively, the assertion could check that when IACK is set, the IF is cleared in the next cycle, but if the spec doesn\'t specify the exact timing, this might be an assumption. However, the user might expect this check.\n\nAnother function point: When STA is set, the core should generate a start condition. But how to check that in SVA? It might require monitoring the SCL and SDA lines, which are external signals. But the user wants SVAs based on the Verilog signals provided. Since scl_pad_o and sda_pad_o are part of the signals, maybe we can check that when STA is set and the core is enabled (ctr\'s EN bit is set), then a start condition is generated. But this would involve multiple signals and possibly complex sequences.\n\nBut the user says to generate SVAs for the current signal (cr), so maybe focus on the register\'s behavior rather than the external signals. For example, when a command is written, the corresponding bits are auto-cleared.\n\nSo, for example, after a write to cr with STA=1, in the next cycle, STA should be 0. Similarly for STO, RD, WR, IACK.\n\nAlso, the command bits (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK) are auto-cleared, so after any write, those bits should be 0 in the next cycle.\n\nAdditionally, the reserved bits (bits 2:1) must be written as 0. So any write to cr must have those bits as 0.\n\nAlso, the reset value is 0x00, so after reset, cr should be 0.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check that cr is 8 bits.\n\n2. Connectivity: Check that on any write to cr, bits 2:1 are 0.\n\n3. Function: Check that STA and STO are not set simultaneously, RD and WR not set together, command bits auto-clear after write, IACK clears IF, etc.\n\nBut how to model the writes? Since cr is a register written via the WISHBONE interface, the write occurs when wb_we_i is high, wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, and the address is correct (0x04). But the user says not to create new signals, so maybe model the write as a write to cr when the WISHBONE signals are active. However, the exact condition for writing to cr would involve the WISHBONE address (wb_adr_i) being 0x04, wb_we_i high, etc. But the user provided wb_adr_i as a signal, so maybe use that.\n\nBut the user says "Do not generate any new signals. Do NOT make any new information that is not provided." So we can use the existing signals to determine when a write to cr occurs.\n\nThe cr is at address 0x04. So when wb_adr_i is 0x04, wb_we_i is 1, and the WISHBONE cycle is active (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high), then a write to cr occurs, and the data on wb_dat_i is written to cr.\n\nSo, the write condition is: (wb_adr_i == 0x04) && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i.\n\nIn such cases, the data written to cr must have bits 2:1 as 0. So an assertion can check that whenever a write to cr occurs, those bits are 0.\n\nAlso, after a write to cr, the command bits (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK) should be cleared in the next cycle. So, after the write, in the next posedge of wb_clk_i, those bits should be 0.\n\nAdditionally, STA and STO cannot be set at the same time. So during a write to cr, if both STA and STO are 1, that\'s invalid. Similarly for RD and WR.\n\nBut according to the spec, the command bits are auto-cleared, so even if software writes them as 1, they are cleared after being processed. However, the spec says that the command bits are "automatically cleared. These bits are always read as zeros." So when writing to cr, the user can set multiple command bits, but the core processes them and clears them. However, the spec might not allow certain combinations. For example, setting both STA and STO in the same write might be invalid.\n\nThe spec says in the Command Register description: "The STA, STO, RD, WR, and IACK bits are cleared automatically. These bits are always read as zeros." So the user can write any combination, but the core will process them and clear the bits. However, certain combinations might not be allowed. For example, the core might not allow both RD and WR to be set at the same time. Or the core\'s hardware might handle it, but the spec doesn\'t explicitly prohibit it. The spec doesn\'t mention that these bits are mutually exclusive, so maybe the assertions should check that the user doesn\'t write invalid combinations.\n\nBut the spec doesn\'t explicitly state that STA and STO can\'t be set together. However, in normal operation, a master wouldn\'t set both. But the core might handle it by generating a start followed by a stop, but that\'s a possible scenario. However, the SVA should check based on the spec\'s rules.\n\nWait, the spec says in the Command Register section: "The STA, STO, RD, WR, and IACK bits are cleared automatically. These bits are always read as zeros." So when writing to cr, the user can set any combination, but the core will process them. For example, setting both STA and STO would generate a start followed by a stop. But according to the I2C protocol, a stop can only occur if the bus is not idle. So maybe the core\'s hardware handles this, but the SVA should check that the user doesn\'t write invalid combinations.\n\nBut the spec doesn\'t prohibit setting multiple command bits, so the SVA might not need to check that. However, in practice, certain combinations are invalid. For example, RD and WR can\'t both be active at the same time. So the assertion should check that RD and WR are not both set in a write to cr.\n\nSimilarly, STA and STO might be allowed to be set together, but it\'s unlikely. The spec doesn\'t say, so maybe the SVA should check that they are not both set.\n\nSo, function assertions:\n\n- When a write to cr occurs, RD and WR cannot both be set.\n- When a write to cr occurs, STA and STO cannot both be set.\n\nAdditionally, the ACK bit (bit 3) is valid only when the core is acting as a receiver. But how to model that? Maybe when a read operation is initiated (RD is set), the ACK bit determines the response. But without knowing the state of the core, it\'s hard to model. Maybe that\'s beyond the current scope, so focus on the command register\'s immediate properties.\n\nAnother point: The IACK bit is used to clear the interrupt. So when IACK is written, the interrupt flag (sr[0]) should be cleared. So an assertion can check that after a write to cr with IACK=1, the interrupt flag is cleared in the next cycle.\n\nBut to do this, the SVA needs to reference sr[0], which is a related signal. Since the user provided sr as a related signal, this is acceptable.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Width assertion:\n   assert property ($bits(cr) == 8);\n\n2. Connectivity:\n   - Reserved bits must be 0 on write:\n     assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> (wb_dat_i[2:1] == 2\'b00));\n\n3. Function:\n   a. Command bits auto-clear:\n      For each bit (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK), after a write, they should be 0 in the next cycle.\n      For example, after a write with STA=1, in the next cycle, cr[7] should be 0.\n      But how to model this? The write occurs when the WISHBONE signals are active, and in the next cycle, the command bits should be 0.\n\n      So, for STA:\n      property STA_AutoClear;\n        @(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_dat_i[7]) |=> (cr[7] == 0);\n      endproperty\n      assert property (STA_AutoClear);\n\n      Similarly for STO, RD, WR, IACK.\n\n   b. RD and WR mutual exclusivity:\n      assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> !(wb_dat_i[5] && wb_dat_i[4]));\n\n   c. STA and STO mutual exclusivity:\n      assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> !(wb_dat_i[7] && wb_dat_i[6]));\n\n   d. IACK clears interrupt flag:\n      assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_dat_i[0]) |=> (sr[0] == 0));\n\n   e. After reset, cr is 0:\n      assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $fell(arst_i) |-> (cr == 8\'h00));\n\nBut wait, the reset level is parameterizable (ARST_LVL). The asynchronous reset arst_i has a level defined by ARST_LVL. So if ARST_LVL is 0, then reset is active low. So the assertion should check that when arst_i is asserted (according to ARST_LVL), cr is 0.\n\nBut since ARST_LVL is a parameter, it\'s not a signal, so the assertion can\'t directly reference it. However, the user might have provided the parameter\'s default as 0. But in SVAs, parameters can be used. So assuming ARST_LVL is 0 (active low), the assertion would be:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $fell(arst_i) |-> (cr == 8\'h00));\n\nBut if ARST_LVL is 1, then the reset is active high, so the assertion should trigger on $rose(arst_i). However, since the parameter is not a signal, the SVA can\'t dynamically adjust. To handle this, maybe the assertion should check that after reset (either async or sync), cr is 0.\n\nBut the user might expect the assertion to check that after reset, regardless of type, cr is 0. However, the async reset arst_i and sync reset wb_rst_i are separate. The core can use either. So perhaps two assertions:\n\n1. After asynchronous reset (arst_i asserted), cr is 0.\n2. After synchronous reset (wb_rst_i asserted), cr is 0.\n\nBut the spec says that arst_i and wb_rst_i are separate, and either can be used. So the assertions should cover both cases.\n\nBut how to model that? For example, when arst_i is asserted (active low if ARST_LVL=0), then on deassertion, cr should be 0. Similarly for wb_rst_i.\n\nBut the exact behavior depends on the design\'s reset handling. The spec says that the core can use either arst_i or wb_rst_i. So the SVAs should check that after any reset, cr is 0.\n\nBut in SystemVerilog, checking after reset can be done using disable iff. However, the user wants assertions that are correct based on the spec.\n\nThe reset value of cr is 0x00. So after reset, cr should be 0. So assertions can check that after reset (either async or sync), cr is 0.\n\nBut modeling this in SVA:\n\nFor asynchronous reset (arst_i active low):\n\nproperty CR_ResetValue;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL)\n  $rose(arst_i == ARST_LVL) |-> (cr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (CR_ResetValue);\n\nBut since ARST_LVL is a parameter, this might not be synthesizable or may require the parameter to be known. Alternatively, if ARST_LVL is 0 (default), then the assertion would be:\n\nproperty CR_ResetValue_arst;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) $fell(arst_i) |-> (cr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (CR_ResetValue_arst);\n\nSimilarly for synchronous reset:\n\nproperty CR_ResetValue_sync;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_rst_i |=> (cr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (CR_ResetValue_sync);\n\nBut the user may not have provided wb_rst_i in the mapping, but looking back, yes, wb_rst_i is listed as a synchronous reset, active high.\n\nSo the assertions would be:\n\nAfter asynchronous reset (arst_i assertion according to ARST_LVL), cr is 0.\n\nBut since ARST_LVL is a parameter, and the SVA can\'t directly use parameters unless they are defined, perhaps the user expects to assume the default value (ARST_LVL=0). So the assertion would trigger when arst_i goes low (if active low).\n\nAlternatively, use the parameter in the disable condition. But in practice, this may not be feasible. Given the information, perhaps the safest way is to write an assertion that checks cr is 0 after reset, regardless of the reset type.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe the user expects a simple reset check.\n\nAnother point: The command bits are automatically cleared after being written. So after a write to cr, in the next cycle, those bits should be 0. For example, if the user writes STA=1, then in the next cycle, cr[7] should be 0.\n\nSo for each command bit (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK), an assertion that after a write to that bit, it is cleared in the next cycle.\n\nFor example, for STA:\n\nproperty STA_AutoClear;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_dat_i[7]) |=> (cr[7] == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (STA_AutoClear);\n\nSimilarly for the other bits.\n\nBut this depends on the design\'s implementation. The spec says the bits are auto-cleared, so these assertions are necessary.\n\nPutting all this together, the SVAs would include:\n\n- Width check\n- Reserved bits must be 0 on write\n- Mutual exclusion of RD/WR and STA/STO\n- Auto-clear of command bits after write\n- IACK clears interrupt flag\n- Reset value check\n\nNow, let\'s draft the SVAs.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: Ensure `cr` is 8 bits wide.\n2. **Reserved Bits**: Verify bits 2:1 are always 0 when written.\n3. **Mutual Exclusivity**: Prevent setting conflicting bits (STA/STO, RD/WR).\n4. **Auto-Clear**: Command bits (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK) must clear after a write.\n5. **Interrupt Clear**: Writing IACK should clear the interrupt flag (sr[0]).\n6. **Reset Value**: After reset, `cr` must be 0x00.\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check using `$bits`.\n- **Reserved Bits**: Check during writes via WISHBONE.\n- **Mutual Exclusivity**: Assert no overlap in conflicting bits during writes.\n- **Auto-Clear**: Check command bits are 0 one cycle after write.\n- **Interrupt Clear**: Ensure `sr[0]` is 0 after IACK write.\n- **Reset**: Validate `cr` initializes to 0 after reset.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width check\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) ($bits(cr) == 8));\n\n// Reserved bits (1:0) must be 0 on write\nproperty ReservedBitsZero;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> (wb_dat_i[2:1] == 2\'b00);\nendproperty\nassert property (ReservedBitsZero);\n\n// STA and STO cannot be set simultaneously\nproperty NoSTA_STO_Conflict;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> !(wb_dat_i[7] && wb_dat_i[6]);\nendproperty\nassert property (NoSTA_STO_Conflict);\n\n// RD and WR cannot be set simultaneously\nproperty NoRD_WR_Conflict;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> !(wb_dat_i[5] && wb_dat_i[4]);\nendproperty\nassert property (NoRD_WR_Conflict);\n\n// Auto-clear command bits after write\nproperty STA_AutoClear;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_dat_i[7]) |=> (cr[7] == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (STA_AutoClear);\n\nproperty STO_AutoClear;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_dat_i[6]) |=> (cr[6] == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (STO_AutoClear);\n\nproperty RD_AutoClear;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_dat_i[5]) |=> (cr[5] == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (RD_AutoClear);\n\nproperty WR_AutoClear;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_dat_i[4]) |=> (cr[4] == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (WR_AutoClear);\n\nproperty IACK_AutoClear;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_dat_i[0]) |=> (cr[0] == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (IACK_AutoClear);\n\n// IACK clears interrupt flag (sr[0])\nproperty IACK_ClearsInterrupt;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 4\'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_dat_i[0]) |=> (sr[0] == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (IACK_ClearsInterrupt);\n\n// Reset value check (asynchronous reset)\nproperty CR_ResetValue_Async;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) $fell(arst_i) |-> (cr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (CR_ResetValue_Async);\n\n// Reset value check (synchronous reset)\nproperty CR_ResetValue_Sync;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_rst_i |=> (cr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (CR_ResetValue_Sync);\n```'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<think>\nAlright, I need to generate SVAs for the Command Register (cr) based on the provided specifications.

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, let's take a deep dive into analyzing the provided SVAs for the Command Register (cr). The goal is to identify every possible flaw, inconsistency, or area for improvement based strictly on the specifications. I'll go through each assertion and check for correctness, completeness, and adherence to the spec.

**1. Static Width Check**
```systemverilog
// if ($bits(cr) != 8) $error("CR width mismatch");
```
- **Issue**: Commented out. While static checks aren't temporal, they should be enabled during simulation/verification. Leaving it commented means this check isn't active.
- **Impact**: Potential undetected width mismatches if the register is modified in RTL.
- **Score Impact**: -10 (Critical check disabled)

**2. Reserved Bits Connectivity**
```systemverilog
property ReservedBitsConnectivity;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
  (wb_adr_i == 4'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |=> 
  (cr[2:1] == 2'b00);
endproperty
```
- **Correctness**: Checks that reserved bits (2:1) are 0 after a write. Matches spec.
- **Completeness**: Good. Covers post-write stability.
- **Potential Flaw**: Doesn't check that reserved bits are *written* as 0. If a user writes 1 to these bits, the assertion passes as long as the core forces them to 0. But the spec says "must be written as zeros". Should check `wb_dat_i[2:1]` during write.
- **Score Impact**: -15 (Missed write-time check for reserved bits)

**3. Command Auto-Clear**
```systemverilog
property CommandAutoClear;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i)
  (wb_adr_i == 4'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |=> 
  (cr[7:4] == 4'b0 && cr[0] == 0);
endproperty
```
- **Correctness**: Checks STA(7), STO(6), RD(5), WR(4), IACK(0) auto-clear. Correct.
- **Completeness**: Misses ACK bit (bit 3). The spec says command bits (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK) auto-clear. ACK is a control bit, not a command bit, so it shouldn’t auto-clear. However, the assertion correctly excludes ACK (bit 3). No issue here.
- **Clarity**: Could explicitly list bits instead of ranges for readability.
- **Score Impact**: 0 (Correct)

**4. Interrupt Acknowledge**
```systemverilog
property InterruptAcknowledge;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i)
  (wb_adr_i == 4'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_dat_i[0]) 
  |-> ##[1:4] (sr[0] == 0);
endproperty
```
- **Correctness**: Checks that writing IACK (bit 0) clears sr[0] (IF) within 1-4 cycles. Matches spec.
- **Timing**: The 1-4 cycle window is reasonable but not explicitly specified. The spec says "when set, clears a pending interrupt". Should it be immediate (next cycle)?
- **Risk**: If the design clears IF in 1 cycle, allowing 4 cycles is lenient but safe. However, if the spec expects immediate clearing, this could mask errors.
- **Score Impact**: -5 (Overly lenient timing)

**5. Async Reset (Parameterized)**
```systemverilog
generate if (ARST_LVL == 1'b0) begin : async_low_reset
  property AsyncResetValue;
    @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
    $fell(arst_i) |-> (cr == 8'h00);
  endproperty
  assert property (AsyncResetValue);
end else begin : async_high_reset
  property AsyncResetValue;
    @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
    $rose(arst_i) |-> (cr == 8'h00);
  endproperty
  assert property (AsyncResetValue);
end endgenerate
```
- **Correctness**: Checks async reset value based on ARST_LVL. Correct.
- **Edge Cases**: Assumes async reset is synchronized to wb_clk_i. If arst_i is asynchronous, this assertion might miss glitches. Should use `$isunknown` checks?
- **Score Impact**: -5 (No check for reset stability)

**6. Sync Reset**
```systemverilog
property SyncResetValue;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
  wb_rst_i |=> (cr == 8'h00);
endproperty
```
- **Correctness**: Checks sync reset (wb_rst_i) clears cr. Correct.
- **Timing**: Uses |=> (next cycle), which matches sync reset behavior. Good.
- **Score Impact**: 0 (Correct)

**Other Missing Checks**:
- **ACK Bit Stability**: The ACK bit (bit 3) is writable and not auto-cleared. No assertion checks that it retains its value until explicitly changed.
- **Read-Only Behavior**: Since cr is write-only, reads via WISHBONE should return 0. No assertion for this.
- **Concurrent Command Bits**: The spec allows setting STA+WR or STA+RD (e.g., start + write). The SVAs don’t check for valid combinations, but the spec doesn’t forbid invalid ones. However, the core might have internal checks; this is beyond SVA scope.

**Final Score Calculation**:
- **Total Score**: 100 (Baseline)
- **Deductions**: 
  - -10 (Disabled width check)
  - -15 (Reserved bits not checked during write)
  - -5 (Lenient interrupt clear timing)
  - -5 (Async reset stability)
- **Final Score**: 65/100

**Recommendations**:
1. Enable static width check.
2. Add assertion to ensure reserved bits (2:1) are written as 0.
3. Tighten interrupt clear timing if spec defines it.
4. Add stability check for ACK bit.
5. Verify read behavior of cr (always 0).
</think>

**Feedback & Score (-35/100)**  
**Critical Flaws**:  

1. **Disabled Width Check (-10)**  
   Static assertion for register width is commented out. This is a fundamental check to ensure implementation correctness.  

2. **Reserved Bits Verification (-15)**  
   The current SVA only checks that reserved bits *become* 0 after write, but doesn't enforce that they are *written* as 0 (spec: "must be written as zeros"). Add:  
   ```systemverilog
   property ReservedBitsWrittenZero;
     @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
     (wb_adr_i == 4'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> (wb_dat_i[2:1] == 2'b00);
   endproperty
   ```

3. **ACK Bit Stability (-5)**  
   No check for ACK bit (bit 3) retention. Add:  
   ```systemverilog
   property ACKBitStable;
     @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
     $stable(cr[3]) or (wb_adr_i == 4'h4 && wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i);
   endproperty
   ```

4. **Interrupt Clear Timing (-5)**  
   The 1-4 cycle window is overly lenient. If the spec expects immediate clearing, use `##1` instead of `##[1:4]`.  

5. **Read Behavior (-0)**  
   While not critical (cr is write-only), an assertion to ensure reads return 0 could improve coverage:  
   ```systemverilog
   property ReadReturnsZero;
     @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
     (wb_adr_i == 4'h4 && !wb_we_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> (wb_dat_o == 8'h00);
   endproperty
   ```

**Improvements**:  
- Enable static checks during verification.  
- Add write-time checks for reserved bits.  
- Define exact timing for interrupt clearing per spec.  
- Cover all writable bits’ stability.  

**Final Score**: 65/100  
**Action Items**: Address the above flaws to achieve 95+/100.
