Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a SystemVerilog assertion with syntax errors and the Jasper log showing the errors. The main issue is the use of 'until_within', which isn't valid in SystemVerilog. I need to correct the assertion to check that wb_we_i remains stable during a transaction.

First, the original assertion uses 'until_within', which isn't a valid operator. I remember that in SystemVerilog, to check that a signal remains stable during a transaction, we can use 'throughout' or check that it's stable at each clock cycle until the end of the transaction.

The original property is supposed to ensure that when wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high (indicating a valid transaction), wb_we_i doesn't change until wb_ack_o is received. The error comes from 'until_within', so I need to replace that with proper sequence syntax.

Looking at the Jasper errors, the syntax error is at 'until_within'. The correct approach might be to use 'throughout' or a sequence that checks stability at each clock cycle. Since 'until_within' isn't valid, perhaps using 'wb_we_i == $past(wb_we_i)' throughout the transaction.

Wait, the correct way is to check that wb_we_i remains stable from the start of the transaction (when cyc and stb are high) until ack is received. So, using a sequence that starts when cyc and stb are high, and then checks at each cycle that wb_we_i is stable until ack occurs.

The 'until' operator in SystemVerilog can be used here. The correct syntax would be something like:

(cyc && stb) |-> ##1 ($stable(wb_we_i)[*0:$] ##1 wb_ack_o)

But that might not capture it correctly. Alternatively, using 'throughout' to ensure that during the entire time from the start until ack, wb_we_i remains stable.

Another approach is to use the 'until' operator with the sequence. So, the property could be written as:

(wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> $stable(wb_we_i) throughout (##[0:$] wb_ack_o)

But I need to make sure that the 'throughout' operator is used correctly. The left-hand side of 'throughout' is the expression that must hold, and the right-hand side is the sequence during which it must hold.

Alternatively, using an implication that once cyc and stb are high, wb_we_i remains stable until ack is received. So, perhaps:

property wb_we_stable_p;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)
  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> $stable(wb_we_i) until wb_ack_o;
endproperty

But 'until' in SystemVerilog requires that the condition eventually happens. However, in this case, the transaction might not complete if ack isn't received, but the assertion should check that if the transaction starts, then we_i remains stable until ack. So using 'until' might be appropriate.

Wait, the original code had 'until_within', which isn't valid. The correct operator is 'until', but perhaps the user intended to check that wb_we_i remains stable until ack occurs, but not necessarily beyond that. So replacing 'until_within' with 'until' might be the fix.

Testing this, the corrected property would be:

property wb_we_stable_p;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)
  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> $stable(wb_we_i) until wb_ack_o;
endproperty

But I should verify the syntax. The 'until' operator is part of the sequence, so maybe it's better to structure it as a sequence.

Alternatively, using a sequence that starts when cyc and stb are high, and then checks that wb_we_i is stable at every cycle until ack is received. This can be done with:

sequence we_stable_s;
  $stable(wb_we_i) throughout (##[0:$] wb_ack_o);
endsequence

property wb_we_stable_p;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)
  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> we_stable_s;
endproperty

This way, the 'throughout' operator ensures that wb_we_i remains stable from the start of the sequence (when cyc and stb are high) until ack is received.

Another possibility is to use consecutive stability checks. For example, once the transaction starts, at every clock cycle, wb_we_i should remain the same as its initial value until ack is received. This can be done by capturing the initial value when the transaction starts and checking it remains the same until ack.

But that would require a local variable. However, the user mentioned not to create new signals. So using $stable(wb_we_i) throughout the time from the start until ack is received.

Putting it all together, the corrected assertion without 'until_within' and using 'throughout' would be:

property wb_we_stable_p;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)
  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> $stable(wb_we_i) throughout (##[0:$] wb_ack_o);
endproperty

But I need to check if '##[0:$] wb_ack_o' is the correct way to model "until ack occurs". The sequence (##[0:$] wb_ack_o) starts at the current cycle and looks for ack in 0 or more cycles. The 'throughout' operator would require that $stable(wb_we_i) holds at every cycle of this sequence.

Alternatively, using 's_until_with' from the SVA library, but that might not be standard. Since 'until_within' is not valid, the correct approach is to use 'throughout' with the sequence that ends when ack is received.

Another approach is to use:

(wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> ##1 ($stable(wb_we_i)[*0:$] ##1 wb_ack_o)

But this might not capture the stability correctly because it allows any number of cycles where wb_we_i is stable, followed by ack. However, this doesn't ensure that wb_we_i is stable in all cycles until ack.

The 'throughout' operator is more appropriate here. Therefore, the corrected assertion should use 'throughout' to ensure that wb_we_i remains stable during all cycles until ack is received.

So the final corrected property is:

property wb_we_stable_p;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)
  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> $stable(wb_we_i) throughout (##[0:$] wb_ack_o);
endproperty
assert property (wb_we_stable_p);

This should fix the syntax error by replacing 'until_within' with 'throughout' and properly structuring the sequence.
