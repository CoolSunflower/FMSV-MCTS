It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

The Byte Command Controller tells the Bit Command Controller\nwhich operation has to be performed. For a single byte read, the Bit Command Controller\nreceives 8 separate read commands. Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the signal wb_inta_o based on the provided specification. Let\'s start by understanding the signal\'s role and its dependencies.\n\nFirst, the description says wb_inta_o is the interrupt output. It asserts when there\'s an interrupt condition, which happens when the IF bit in the Status register is set and the IEN bit in the Control register is enabled. So the interrupt should only be active when both IEN and IF are high.\n\nLooking at the related signals: IEN is part of the Control register (ctr), and IF is in the Status register (sr). The Wishbone clock (wb_clk_i) and resets (wb_rst_i, arst_i) are also important for timing and reset conditions.\n\nI need to create assertions that check the width, connectivity, and functionality of wb_inta_o.\n\nFor width: The signal is 1-bit, so a simple check using $bits.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that wb_inta_o is driven correctly based on the control and status registers. Also, check that it\'s de-asserted during resets.\n\nFunctionality: The main functionality is that wb_inta_o should be high only when both IEN and IF are high. Also, after an interrupt is acknowledged (IACK in Command register), the interrupt should be cleared.\n\nWait, the Command register\'s IACK bit, when set, clears the interrupt. So when IACK is written, the interrupt should drop. But the IACK bit is auto-cleared, so the assertion needs to check that after IACK is set, the interrupt de-asserts.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_inta_o should be low.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check that wb_inta_o is 1 bit.\n\n2. Connectivity: Check that during normal operation (not in reset), the interrupt follows IEN & IF. Also, check that resets de-assert it.\n\n3. Functionality: Ensure that when IEN and IF are both high, the interrupt is asserted. Also, when IACK is written, the interrupt clears.\n\nBut how to model the IACK? The Command register (cr) has an IACK bit. When the core writes IACK, it should clear the interrupt. However, the IACK bit is auto-cleared, so the assertion needs to check that after a write to cr with IACK set, the interrupt goes low.\n\nWait, the spec says: "The STA, STO, RD, WR, and IACK bits are cleared automatically. These bits are always read as zeros." So when the user sets IACK in the Command register, the core clears it automatically. So the effect of setting IACK is to clear the interrupt flag (IF), which in turn would clear wb_inta_o if IEN is still enabled.\n\nBut the Status register\'s IF bit is cleared when IACK is set. So the assertion should check that when IACK is written, the interrupt is de-asserted in the next cycle.\n\nBut how to detect that the Command register was written with IACK set? Since the Wishbone interface is used, when the CPU writes to the Command register (address 0x04) with the IACK bit set, then the interrupt should be cleared.\n\nBut the SVAs need to track when a write to the Command register occurs with the IACK bit set. However, the Wishbone signals wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, and the address wb_adr_i would indicate a write to the Command register.\n\nAlternatively, since the internal registers are named (like cr), perhaps we can reference cr directly. For example, when cr\'s IACK bit is set, then in the next cycle, wb_inta_o should be low.\n\nBut the problem is that the IACK bit is auto-cleared, so it\'s only high for one cycle. So maybe the assertion should check that when a write to the Command register with IACK bit set occurs, then the interrupt is cleared.\n\nBut the exact timing depends on when the Command register is written. Since the Wishbone interface takes two cycles for each access, but the exact timing might be tricky. However, the specification says that the core\'s outputs are registered, so the effect of writing IACK would take effect after the write completes.\n\nAlternatively, since the IACK bit in cr is a write-only bit that\'s auto-cleared, the assertion can check that whenever IACK is set (even momentarily), the interrupt is de-asserted in the next cycle.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check that whenever the interrupt is asserted (wb_inta_o is high), it\'s because both IEN and IF are high. And when either IEN or IF is low, the interrupt should be low.\n\nAlso, after a reset, the interrupt should be low.\n\nSo the functionality assertions would include:\n\n- If not in reset, wb_inta_o should be equal to (ctr.IEN && sr.IF).\n\nBut need to consider the registered nature. Since wb_inta_o is a registered output, the value would be based on the current state of IEN and IF.\n\nWait, but the interrupt is generated when IF is set and IEN is enabled. So the SVA should check that whenever IEN and IF are both high, wb_inta_o is high, and otherwise, it\'s low.\n\nBut there might be a clock cycle delay between the IF being set and the interrupt being asserted, depending on how the core is designed. However, the specification says that wb_inta_o is a registered signal, so it\'s synchronized to the clock. Therefore, the assertion should check that wb_inta_o is high in the same cycle that IEN and IF are both high, assuming the registers are updated synchronously.\n\nBut perhaps the core\'s internal logic sets IF, and in the next clock edge, wb_inta_o is updated. The specification doesn\'t specify the exact timing, but since it\'s a registered output, it\'s likely that the interrupt is registered, so the value of wb_inta_o at the posedge of wb_clk_i reflects the state of IEN and IF at that time.\n\nTherefore, the assertion can be:\n\nwb_inta_o == (ctr[IEN] && sr[IF])\n\nBut need to use the actual bit positions for IEN and IF in the control and status registers.\n\nFrom the spec:\n\nControl register (ctr) bits:\n- EN: enable bit\n- IEN: interrupt enable bit\n\nStatus register (sr) bits:\n- IF: interrupt flag\n\nLooking at the register descriptions:\n\nControl Register (Section 3.2.2):\nBits:\n- EN (bit 0): RW\n- IEN (bit 1): RW\n\nStatus Register (Section 3.2.6):\nBits:\n- RxACK (bit 0): R\n- Busy (bit 1): R\n- AL (bit 2): R\n- TIP (bit 3): R\n- IF (bit 4): R\n\nSo IF is bit 4 of the status register (sr[4]), and IEN is bit 1 of the control register (ctr[1]).\n\nTherefore, the functionality assertion would be:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) (wb_inta_o == (ctr[1] && sr[4])) );\n\nBut need to consider resets. The disable iff clause should account for asynchronous reset (arst_i) and synchronous reset (wb_rst_i). The ARST_LVL parameter determines the active level of arst_i.\n\nAlso, during reset, wb_inta_o should be de-asserted. So another assertion checks that during reset, wb_inta_o is low.\n\nFor connectivity, check that when the core is not enabled (ctr[EN] is 0), the interrupt is not asserted. But that\'s already covered by the functionality assertion since IEN is part of ctr.\n\nWait, ctr[EN] is the enable bit for the core. However, the interrupt enable is ctr[IEN], which is a separate bit. So even if the core is disabled (EN=0), if IEN is 1 and IF is 1, the interrupt would still be asserted. But according to the spec, when the core is disabled (EN=0), it should not be active. Wait, no: the Control register\'s IEN bit is separate from the EN bit. The EN bit enables the core\'s operation, but the IEN bit enables interrupts. So even if the core is disabled (EN=0), if IEN is 1 and IF is 1, the interrupt would still be generated. But according to the spec, when the core is disabled, pending commands are finished. However, the interrupt could still be pending. But the spec doesn\'t explicitly say that EN affects the interrupt. So the functionality assertion should only consider IEN and IF, not EN.\n\nTherefore, the main functionality is wb_inta_o == (ctr[1] && sr[4]).\n\nFor connectivity, we need to ensure that the interrupt is properly connected to the WISHBONE interface and that it\'s driven low when the core is not selected (e.g., when wb_stb_i or wb_cyc_i is low). Wait, but the WISHBONE interface is for register access. The interrupt output (wb_inta_o) is a separate signal that doesn\'t depend on wb_stb_i or wb_cyc_i. The interrupt is based on internal conditions (IEN and IF), not on bus transactions. So connectivity assertions here would focus on the relationship between wb_inta_o and the control/status bits, not the WISHBONE select signals.\n\nBut maybe a connectivity check is to ensure that when the core is not in reset and the IEN and IF are set, the interrupt is asserted. Also, during reset, it\'s de-asserted.\n\nSo the connectivity assertions would include:\n\n- When in reset (arst_i active or wb_rst_i high), wb_inta_o is 0.\n\n- When not in reset, wb_inta_o is driven as per IEN and IF.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_inta_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity assertions:\n\n1. During reset, wb_inta_o is 0.\n\n2. When not in reset, wb_inta_o is driven as (IEN && IF).\n\nFunctionality assertions:\n\n1. After an interrupt is acknowledged (IACK bit set in Command register), wb_inta_o de-asserts.\n\nBut how to model this? The IACK bit in the Command register (cr) is bit 7 (from Section 3.2.5):\n\nCommand register bits:\n- STA (bit 0)\n- STO (bit 1)\n- RD (bit 2)\n- WR (bit 3)\n- ACK (bit 4)\n- Reserved (bits 5-6)\n- IACK (bit 7)\n\nWhen the IACK bit is written (set to 1), it clears the interrupt flag (IF) in the Status register. Therefore, after writing IACK, the IF bit should be cleared, which in turn should de-assert wb_inta_o if IEN is still 1.\n\nBut the assertion needs to check that when IACK is written, the interrupt is cleared. However, since the IACK bit is auto-cleared, the write to the Command register with IACK set will cause the IF bit to be cleared in the next cycle.\n\nSo the assertion would be: After a write to the Command register with IACK bit set, in the next cycle, wb_inta_o should be 0.\n\nBut how to detect a write to the Command register? The Wishbone signals wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, and the address wb_adr_i must indicate a write to the Command register\'s address (0x04). Alternatively, since the internal register is named cr, we can check when cr is written with the IACK bit set.\n\nBut in SVA, we can\'t directly observe internal registers unless they are part of the design\'s ports. However, the problem statement says not to create new signals, so we have to use the available signals.\n\nThe Wishbone interface writes to the Command register when wb_we_i is high, wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, and the address wb_adr_i is 0x04 (assuming the address decoding). But the exact address mapping isn\'t provided in the signal list. The registers are at addresses 0x00 (PRERlo), 0x01 (PRERhi), 0x02 (CTR), 0x03 (TXR/RXR), 0x04 (CR/SR). So writing to address 0x04 with wb_we_i high would write to the Command register (CR).\n\nSo the write to CR occurs when wb_adr_i == 3\'h4 (assuming 3-bit address since the registers are from 0x00 to 0x04, which is 5 addresses, needing 3 bits). But the exact address width isn\'t specified. The signal wb_adr_i is listed as "Lower address bits for Wishbone interface", but the width isn\'t given. However, the registers are at addresses 0x00 to 0x04, so wb_adr_i is at least 3 bits.\n\nAssuming that a write to address 0x04 (CR) with data bit 7 set (IACK) will clear the interrupt.\n\nSo the assertion would be: After a write to CR with IACK bit set, wb_inta_o should be 0 in the next cycle.\n\nBut how to model this in SVA? The write occurs when wb_we_i is high, wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, wb_adr_i is 0x04, and wb_dat_i[7] is 1 (IACK bit). Then, in the next cycle, wb_inta_o should be 0.\n\nBut the Wishbone handshake requires wb_ack_o to be asserted, but the exact timing may vary. However, the problem states that each access takes 2 clock cycles. So the write happens on the first cycle, and the ack is on the second. But the exact timing of when the Command register is updated isn\'t clear. Assuming that the write to CR is captured on the posedge of wb_clk_i when the Wishbone transaction is completed (acknowledged), then the IACK bit is set in that cycle, and the IF is cleared in the next cycle.\n\nBut this might be too detailed. Alternatively, since the IACK bit is auto-cleared, the act of setting it (even momentarily) should cause the IF to clear, thus de-asserting wb_inta_o if IEN is still 1.\n\nBut perhaps the key point is that when IACK is set, the IF bit is cleared, which affects wb_inta_o. So the assertion can check that whenever IACK is set in the Command register, in the next cycle, wb_inta_o is 0, provided IEN remains 1.\n\nBut since the Command register\'s IACK bit is auto-cleared, it\'s only high for one cycle. So the SVA would need to check that after a rising edge of the IACK bit, the interrupt is de-asserted.\n\nAlternatively, the assertion can check that when the IACK bit is written, the interrupt flag (IF) is cleared, which in turn clears wb_inta_o.\n\nBut without access to internal signals like IF, we have to rely on the status register (sr) which is read-only. However, the problem statement allows using the provided signals, including sr.\n\nWait, the signal list includes sr as the status register. So sr[4] is the IF bit.\n\nSo when IACK is written, the IF bit should be cleared in the next cycle, causing wb_inta_o to go low if IEN is still 1.\n\nBut how to detect that IACK was written? The Wishbone write to CR with bit 7 set.\n\nSo the assertion would be: After a write to CR with IACK bit set, in the next cycle, sr[4] is 0, leading to wb_inta_o being 0 (if IEN is still 1).\n\nBut this might be covered by the functionality assertion that wb_inta_o is always (IEN && IF). So if IACK causes IF to clear, then wb_inta_o should de-assert.\n\nTherefore, the main functionality is covered by the assertion that wb_inta_o equals (ctr[1] && sr[4]). The specific case of IACK is already covered because setting IACK clears IF, which would make sr[4] 0, thus wb_inta_o should be 0.\n\nSo perhaps the functionality assertion is sufficient, and the IACK case doesn\'t need a separate assertion because it\'s implied by the relationship between IEN, IF, and wb_inta_o.\n\nTherefore, the key assertions are:\n\n1. Width: Check wb_inta_o is 1 bit.\n\n2. Connectivity: During reset, wb_inta_o is 0. When not in reset, it\'s driven as IEN && IF.\n\n3. Functionality: wb_inta_o is always equal to IEN && IF when not in reset.\n\nAdditionally, check that after a reset, wb_inta_o is 0.\n\nPutting this into SVAs:\n\nWidth assertion:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_inta_o) == 1);\n\nConnectivity assertions:\n\n// During reset, interrupt is low\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_inta_o);\n\n// When not in reset, interrupt is IEN && IF\nproperty inta_functionality;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n    (wb_inta_o == (ctr[1] && sr[4]));\nendproperty\nassert property (inta_functionality);\n\nFunctionality could also include that after a write to CR with IACK, the interrupt is cleared. But since IACK clears the IF bit, which is part of the status register, the existing functionality assertion covers this.\n\nAnother point: The interrupt should assert when a transfer completes (TIP goes low) and IF is set, provided IEN is enabled.\n\nBut the existing assertion covers this as well.\n\nSo the final SVAs are the width check, reset check, and the functionality check.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: Verify `wb_inta_o` is 1-bit wide.\n2. **Reset Connectivity**: Ensure `wb_inta_o` is de-asserted during resets (asynchronous `arst_i` or synchronous `wb_rst_i`).\n3. **Functional Dependency**: Check `wb_inta_o` asserts **only** when both `IEN` (Control reg) and `IF` (Status reg) are high.\n4. **Interrupt Clear**: Validate `wb_inta_o` de-asserts after interrupt acknowledgment (`IACK` in Command reg).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check using `$bits`.\n- **Reset**: Use `disable iff` to handle resets and check `wb_inta_o` is low.\n- **Functionality**: Assert `wb_inta_o` equals `IEN & IF` when not in reset.\n- **IACK Handling**: Ensure `wb_inta_o` drops after `IACK` is written (via `cr[7]`).\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) ($bits(wb_inta_o) == 1));\n\n// Connectivity: Interrupt de-asserted during resets\nproperty inta_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_inta_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (inta_reset);\n\n// Functionality: Interrupt = IEN & IF when not in reset\nproperty inta_functional;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_inta_o == (ctr[1] && sr[4]);\nendproperty\nassert property (inta_functional);\n\n// Interrupt clear after IACK\nproperty inta_iack_clear;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && (wb_adr_i == 3\'h4) && wb_dat_i[7]) |=> !wb_inta_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (inta_iack_clear);\n```'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<think>\nOkay, let\'s analyze the provided SVAs for `wb_inta_o` step by step, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, and potential flaws.\n\n### **1.

The assertion should directly use `arst_i == ARST_LVL` to detect active reset.  \n- **Flaw 2**: The assertion does not account for asynchronous reset behavior. `arst_i` can assert asynchronously, but the check is synchronized to `wb_clk_i`, missing transitions between clock edges.  \n- **Impact**: Fails to properly model asynchronous reset and uses inverted reset logic.  \n- **Score Impact**: -30 (incorrect reset condition and synchronization).\n\n---\n\n### **3.

However, `wb_inta_o` is a registered output, so there may be a 1-cycle delay between `IEN/IF` changes and `wb_inta_o` reflecting them. The spec does not clarify this timing, making the assertion potentially overconstrained.  \n- **Impact**: Incorrect reset handling and possible timing mismatch.  \n- **Score Impact**: -20 (reset condition) -10 (timing assumption) = -30.\n\n---\n\n### **4. IACK Clear Assertion**\n```systemverilog\nproperty inta_iack_clear;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && (wb_adr_i == 3\'h4) && wb_dat_i[7]) |=> !wb_inta_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (inta_iack_clear);\n```\n- **Flaw 1**: The address `3\'h4` assumes a 3-bit address bus, but the spec uses addresses up to 0x04 (5 addresses), which requires at least 3 bits. This is correct but should explicitly reference the spec’s address mapping.  \n- **Flaw 2**: The assertion assumes `wb_inta_o` de-asserts **immediately** in the next cycle after writing `IACK`. However, the spec states that `IACK` clears the interrupt flag (`IF`), which in turn affects `wb_inta_o`. If `IF` is cleared in the same cycle as the `IACK` write, `wb_inta_o` would de-assert in the **same** cycle, not the next. The assertion’s `|=>` (next cycle) is incorrect.  \n- **Flaw 3**: The assertion does not check if `IEN` remains enabled. If `IEN` is disabled after `IACK`, `wb_inta_o` would de-assert regardless of `IF`, leading to a false positive.  \n- **Impact**: Incorrect timing for `IACK` effect and incomplete condition.  \n- **Score Impact**: -20 (timing) -10 (missing IEN check) = -30.\n\n---\n\n### **Other Flaws**\n1. **Clock Cycle Misinterpretation**:  \n   - All assertions use `posedge wb_clk_i` but do not account for potential setup/hold times or combinatorial delays in the design. For example, `wb_inta_o` might be updated combinatorially based on `IEN` and `IF`, but the spec states it is a registered output. This needs explicit confirmation.  \n   - **Impact**: Unclear timing assumptions. (-10)\n\n2. **Nested Conditions**:  \n   - The `IACK` assertion uses a long combinatorial condition (`wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && ...`). This is acceptable but could be simplified by referencing internal signals (e.g., `cr[7]`) if allowed. However, the problem restricts using only provided signals.  \n   - **Impact**: Minor readability issue. (-5)\n\n3. **Completeness**:  \n   - No check for glitches or spurious interrupts (e.g., `wb_inta_o` pulses when `IEN` or `IF` changes transiently).  \n   - **Impact**: Incomplete coverage.

Remove redundant nested conditions where possible.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate SVAs for wb_inta_o. \n[Signal name]: wb_inta_o\n[Description]:\n    [Definition]: 1-bit output signal serving as the Interrupt signal output from the I2C core.\n    [Functionality]: Asserts when an interrupt condition is present—triggered by internal events such as a completed byte transfer or arbitration loss. This occurs when the interrupt flag (IF) in the Status register is set and the interrupt enable (IEN) bit in the Control register is active.\n    [Interconnection]: Part of the WISHBONE interface, it interfaces with the system\'s interrupt controller or processor. It operates alongside internal registers (Control register’s IEN and Status register’s IF) and other bus signals (e.g., wb_clk_i) to manage interrupt-driven operations.\n    [Additional information]: Being a registered signal, wb_inta_o is synchronized with the master clock, ensuring reliable timing for interrupt notifications.\n[Related Signals]: IEN (Control register), IF (Status register), wb_clk_i, wb_rst_i, wb_cyc_i, wb_stb_i, wb_ack_o.\nPlease refine your old answer: <think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the signal wb_inta_o based on the provided specification. Let\'s start by understanding the signal\'s role and its dependencies.\n\nFirst, the description says wb_inta_o is the interrupt output. It asserts when there\'s an interrupt condition, which happens when the IF bit in the Status register is set and the IEN bit in the Control register is enabled. So the interrupt should only be active when both IEN and IF are high.\n\nLooking at the related signals: IEN is part of the Control register (ctr), and IF is in the Status register (sr). The Wishbone clock (wb_clk_i) and resets (wb_rst_i, arst_i) are also important for timing and reset conditions.\n\nI need to create assertions that check the width, connectivity, and functionality of wb_inta_o.\n\nFor width: The signal is 1-bit, so a simple check using $bits.\n\nConnectivity: Ensure that wb_inta_o is driven correctly based on the control and status registers. Also, check that it\'s de-asserted during resets.\n\nFunctionality: The main functionality is that wb_inta_o should be high only when both IEN and IF are high. Also, after an interrupt is acknowledged (IACK in Command register), the interrupt should be cleared.\n\nWait, the Command register\'s IACK bit, when set, clears the interrupt. So when IACK is written, the interrupt should drop. But the IACK bit is auto-cleared, so the assertion needs to check that after IACK is set, the interrupt de-asserts.\n\nAlso, during reset (either synchronous wb_rst_i or asynchronous arst_i), wb_inta_o should be low.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check that wb_inta_o is 1 bit.\n\n2. Connectivity: Check that during normal operation (not in reset), the interrupt follows IEN & IF. Also, check that resets de-assert it.\n\n3. Functionality: Ensure that when IEN and IF are both high, the interrupt is asserted. Also, when IACK is written, the interrupt clears.\n\nBut how to model the IACK? The Command register (cr) has an IACK bit. When the core writes IACK, it should clear the interrupt. However, the IACK bit is auto-cleared, so the assertion needs to check that after a write to cr with IACK set, the interrupt goes low.\n\nWait, the spec says: "The STA, STO, RD, WR, and IACK bits are cleared automatically. These bits are always read as zeros." So when the user sets IACK in the Command register, the core clears it automatically. So the effect of setting IACK is to clear the interrupt flag (IF), which in turn would clear wb_inta_o if IEN is still enabled.\n\nBut the Status register\'s IF bit is cleared when IACK is set. So the assertion should check that when IACK is written, the interrupt is de-asserted in the next cycle.\n\nBut how to detect that the Command register was written with IACK set? Since the Wishbone interface is used, when the CPU writes to the Command register (address 0x04) with the IACK bit set, then the interrupt should be cleared.\n\nBut the SVAs need to track when a write to the Command register occurs with the IACK bit set. However, the Wishbone signals wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, and the address wb_adr_i would indicate a write to the Command register.\n\nAlternatively, since the internal registers are named (like cr), perhaps we can reference cr directly. For example, when cr\'s IACK bit is set, then in the next cycle, wb_inta_o should be low.\n\nBut the problem is that the IACK bit is auto-cleared, so it\'s only high for one cycle. So maybe the assertion should check that when a write to the Command register with IACK bit set occurs, then the interrupt is cleared.\n\nBut the exact timing depends on when the Command register is written. Since the Wishbone interface takes two cycles for each access, but the exact timing might be tricky. However, the specification says that the core\'s outputs are registered, so the effect of writing IACK would take effect after the write completes.\n\nAlternatively, since the IACK bit in cr is a write-only bit that\'s auto-cleared, the assertion can check that whenever IACK is set (even momentarily), the interrupt is de-asserted in the next cycle.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check that whenever the interrupt is asserted (wb_inta_o is high), it\'s because both IEN and IF are high. And when either IEN or IF is low, the interrupt should be low.\n\nAlso, after a reset, the interrupt should be low.\n\nSo the functionality assertions would include:\n\n- If not in reset, wb_inta_o should be equal to (ctr.IEN && sr.IF).\n\nBut need to consider the registered nature. Since wb_inta_o is a registered output, the value would be based on the current state of IEN and IF.\n\nWait, but the interrupt is generated when IF is set and IEN is enabled. So the SVA should check that whenever IEN and IF are both high, wb_inta_o is high, and otherwise, it\'s low.\n\nBut there might be a clock cycle delay between the IF being set and the interrupt being asserted, depending on how the core is designed. However, the specification says that wb_inta_o is a registered signal, so it\'s synchronized to the clock. Therefore, the assertion should check that wb_inta_o is high in the same cycle that IEN and IF are both high, assuming the registers are updated synchronously.\n\nBut perhaps the core\'s internal logic sets IF, and in the next clock edge, wb_inta_o is updated. The specification doesn\'t specify the exact timing, but since it\'s a registered output, it\'s likely that the interrupt is registered, so the value of wb_inta_o at the posedge of wb_clk_i reflects the state of IEN and IF at that time.\n\nTherefore, the assertion can be:\n\nwb_inta_o == (ctr[IEN] && sr[IF])\n\nBut need to use the actual bit positions for IEN and IF in the control and status registers.\n\nFrom the spec:\n\nControl register (ctr) bits:\n- EN: enable bit\n- IEN: interrupt enable bit\n\nStatus register (sr) bits:\n- IF: interrupt flag\n\nLooking at the register descriptions:\n\nControl Register (Section 3.2.2):\nBits:\n- EN (bit 0): RW\n- IEN (bit 1): RW\n\nStatus Register (Section 3.2.6):\nBits:\n- RxACK (bit 0): R\n- Busy (bit 1): R\n- AL (bit 2): R\n- TIP (bit 3): R\n- IF (bit 4): R\n\nSo IF is bit 4 of the status register (sr[4]), and IEN is bit 1 of the control register (ctr[1]).\n\nTherefore, the functionality assertion would be:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) (wb_inta_o == (ctr[1] && sr[4])) );\n\nBut need to consider resets. The disable iff clause should account for asynchronous reset (arst_i) and synchronous reset (wb_rst_i). The ARST_LVL parameter determines the active level of arst_i.\n\nAlso, during reset, wb_inta_o should be de-asserted. So another assertion checks that during reset, wb_inta_o is low.\n\nFor connectivity, check that when the core is not enabled (ctr[EN] is 0), the interrupt is not asserted. But that\'s already covered by the functionality assertion since IEN is part of ctr.\n\nWait, ctr[EN] is the enable bit for the core. However, the interrupt enable is ctr[IEN], which is a separate bit. So even if the core is disabled (EN=0), if IEN is 1 and IF is 1, the interrupt would still be asserted. But according to the spec, when the core is disabled (EN=0), it should not be active. Wait, no: the Control register\'s IEN bit is separate from the EN bit. The EN bit enables the core\'s operation, but the IEN bit enables interrupts. So even if the core is disabled (EN=0), if IEN is 1 and IF is 1, the interrupt would still be generated. But according to the spec, when the core is disabled, pending commands are finished. However, the interrupt could still be pending. But the spec doesn\'t explicitly say that EN affects the interrupt. So the functionality assertion should only consider IEN and IF, not EN.\n\nTherefore, the main functionality is wb_inta_o == (ctr[1] && sr[4]).\n\nFor connectivity, we need to ensure that the interrupt is properly connected to the WISHBONE interface and that it\'s driven low when the core is not selected (e.g., when wb_stb_i or wb_cyc_i is low). Wait, but the WISHBONE interface is for register access. The interrupt output (wb_inta_o) is a separate signal that doesn\'t depend on wb_stb_i or wb_cyc_i. The interrupt is based on internal conditions (IEN and IF), not on bus transactions. So connectivity assertions here would focus on the relationship between wb_inta_o and the control/status bits, not the WISHBONE select signals.\n\nBut maybe a connectivity check is to ensure that when the core is not in reset and the IEN and IF are set, the interrupt is asserted. Also, during reset, it\'s de-asserted.\n\nSo the connectivity assertions would include:\n\n- When in reset (arst_i active or wb_rst_i high), wb_inta_o is 0.\n\n- When not in reset, wb_inta_o is driven as per IEN and IF.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_inta_o is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity assertions:\n\n1. During reset, wb_inta_o is 0.\n\n2. When not in reset, wb_inta_o is driven as (IEN && IF).\n\nFunctionality assertions:\n\n1. After an interrupt is acknowledged (IACK bit set in Command register), wb_inta_o de-asserts.\n\nBut how to model this? The IACK bit in the Command register (cr) is bit 7 (from Section 3.2.5):\n\nCommand register bits:\n- STA (bit 0)\n- STO (bit 1)\n- RD (bit 2)\n- WR (bit 3)\n- ACK (bit 4)\n- Reserved (bits 5-6)\n- IACK (bit 7)\n\nWhen the IACK bit is written (set to 1), it clears the interrupt flag (IF) in the Status register. Therefore, after writing IACK, the IF bit should be cleared, which in turn should de-assert wb_inta_o if IEN is still 1.\n\nBut the assertion needs to check that when IACK is written, the interrupt is cleared. However, since the IACK bit is auto-cleared, the write to the Command register with IACK set will cause the IF bit to be cleared in the next cycle.\n\nSo the assertion would be: After a write to the Command register with IACK bit set, in the next cycle, wb_inta_o should be 0.\n\nBut how to detect a write to the Command register? The Wishbone signals wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, and the address wb_adr_i must indicate a write to the Command register\'s address (0x04). Alternatively, since the internal register is named cr, we can check when cr is written with the IACK bit set.\n\nBut in SVA, we can\'t directly observe internal registers unless they are part of the design\'s ports. However, the problem statement says not to create new signals, so we have to use the available signals.\n\nThe Wishbone interface writes to the Command register when wb_we_i is high, wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, and the address wb_adr_i is 0x04 (assuming the address decoding). But the exact address mapping isn\'t provided in the signal list. The registers are at addresses 0x00 (PRERlo), 0x01 (PRERhi), 0x02 (CTR), 0x03 (TXR/RXR), 0x04 (CR/SR). So writing to address 0x04 with wb_we_i high would write to the Command register (CR).\n\nSo the write to CR occurs when wb_adr_i == 3\'h4 (assuming 3-bit address since the registers are from 0x00 to 0x04, which is 5 addresses, needing 3 bits). But the exact address width isn\'t specified. The signal wb_adr_i is listed as "Lower address bits for Wishbone interface", but the width isn\'t given. However, the registers are at addresses 0x00 to 0x04, so wb_adr_i is at least 3 bits.\n\nAssuming that a write to address 0x04 (CR) with data bit 7 set (IACK) will clear the interrupt.\n\nSo the assertion would be: After a write to CR with IACK bit set, wb_inta_o should be 0 in the next cycle.\n\nBut how to model this in SVA? The write occurs when wb_we_i is high, wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, wb_adr_i is 0x04, and wb_dat_i[7] is 1 (IACK bit). Then, in the next cycle, wb_inta_o should be 0.\n\nBut the Wishbone handshake requires wb_ack_o to be asserted, but the exact timing may vary. However, the problem states that each access takes 2 clock cycles. So the write happens on the first cycle, and the ack is on the second. But the exact timing of when the Command register is updated isn\'t clear. Assuming that the write to CR is captured on the posedge of wb_clk_i when the Wishbone transaction is completed (acknowledged), then the IACK bit is set in that cycle, and the IF is cleared in the next cycle.\n\nBut this might be too detailed. Alternatively, since the IACK bit is auto-cleared, the act of setting it (even momentarily) should cause the IF to clear, thus de-asserting wb_inta_o if IEN is still 1.\n\nBut perhaps the key point is that when IACK is set, the IF bit is cleared, which affects wb_inta_o. So the assertion can check that whenever IACK is set in the Command register, in the next cycle, wb_inta_o is 0, provided IEN remains 1.\n\nBut since the Command register\'s IACK bit is auto-cleared, it\'s only high for one cycle. So the SVA would need to check that after a rising edge of the IACK bit, the interrupt is de-asserted.\n\nAlternatively, the assertion can check that when the IACK bit is written, the interrupt flag (IF) is cleared, which in turn clears wb_inta_o.\n\nBut without access to internal signals like IF, we have to rely on the status register (sr) which is read-only. However, the problem statement allows using the provided signals, including sr.\n\nWait, the signal list includes sr as the status register. So sr[4] is the IF bit.\n\nSo when IACK is written, the IF bit should be cleared in the next cycle, causing wb_inta_o to go low if IEN is still 1.\n\nBut how to detect that IACK was written? The Wishbone write to CR with bit 7 set.\n\nSo the assertion would be: After a write to CR with IACK bit set, in the next cycle, sr[4] is 0, leading to wb_inta_o being 0 (if IEN is still 1).\n\nBut this might be covered by the functionality assertion that wb_inta_o is always (IEN && IF). So if IACK causes IF to clear, then wb_inta_o should de-assert.\n\nTherefore, the main functionality is covered by the assertion that wb_inta_o equals (ctr[1] && sr[4]). The specific case of IACK is already covered because setting IACK clears IF, which would make sr[4] 0, thus wb_inta_o should be 0.\n\nSo perhaps the functionality assertion is sufficient, and the IACK case doesn\'t need a separate assertion because it\'s implied by the relationship between IEN, IF, and wb_inta_o.\n\nTherefore, the key assertions are:\n\n1. Width: Check wb_inta_o is 1 bit.\n\n2. Connectivity: During reset, wb_inta_o is 0. When not in reset, it\'s driven as IEN && IF.\n\n3. Functionality: wb_inta_o is always equal to IEN && IF when not in reset.\n\nAdditionally, check that after a reset, wb_inta_o is 0.\n\nPutting this into SVAs:\n\nWidth assertion:\n\nassert property ($bits(wb_inta_o) == 1);\n\nConnectivity assertions:\n\n// During reset, interrupt is low\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_inta_o);\n\n// When not in reset, interrupt is IEN && IF\nproperty inta_functionality;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n    (wb_inta_o == (ctr[1] && sr[4]));\nendproperty\nassert property (inta_functionality);\n\nFunctionality could also include that after a write to CR with IACK, the interrupt is cleared. But since IACK clears the IF bit, which is part of the status register, the existing functionality assertion covers this.\n\nAnother point: The interrupt should assert when a transfer completes (TIP goes low) and IF is set, provided IEN is enabled.\n\nBut the existing assertion covers this as well.\n\nSo the final SVAs are the width check, reset check, and the functionality check.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: Verify `wb_inta_o` is 1-bit wide.\n2. **Reset Connectivity**: Ensure `wb_inta_o` is de-asserted during resets (asynchronous `arst_i` or synchronous `wb_rst_i`).\n3. **Functional Dependency**: Check `wb_inta_o` asserts **only** when both `IEN` (Control reg) and `IF` (Status reg) are high.\n4. **Interrupt Clear**: Validate `wb_inta_o` de-asserts after interrupt acknowledgment (`IACK` in Command reg).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check using `$bits`.\n- **Reset**: Use `disable iff` to handle resets and check `wb_inta_o` is low.\n- **Functionality**: Assert `wb_inta_o` equals `IEN & IF` when not in reset.\n- **IACK Handling**: Ensure `wb_inta_o` drops after `IACK` is written (via `cr[7]`).\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) ($bits(wb_inta_o) == 1));\n\n// Connectivity: Interrupt de-asserted during resets\nproperty inta_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_inta_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (inta_reset);\n\n// Functionality: Interrupt = IEN & IF when not in reset\nproperty inta_functional;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_inta_o == (ctr[1] && sr[4]);\nendproperty\nassert property (inta_functional);\n\n// Interrupt clear after IACK\nproperty inta_iack_clear;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && (wb_adr_i == 3\'h4) && wb_dat_i[7]) |=> !wb_inta_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (inta_iack_clear);\n```.\n\nAccording to the Feedback: <think>\nOkay, let\'s analyze the provided SVAs for `wb_inta_o` step by step, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, and potential flaws.\n\n### **1. Width Assertion**\n```systemverilog\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) ($bits(wb_inta_o) == 1));\n```\n- **Flaw**: This assertion checks the width of `wb_inta_o` at every clock edge. However, `$bits` is a compile-time check, not a runtime assertion. Using it in a `property` is redundant and incorrect because the width of a signal cannot change dynamically during simulation. This assertion will either pass always (if the signal is 1-bit) or fail at compile time.  \n- **Impact**: Incorrect usage of `$bits` in a dynamic assertion.  \n- **Score Impact**: -20 (incorrect assertion type).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Reset Connectivity Assertion**\n```systemverilog\nproperty inta_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_inta_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (inta_reset);\n```\n- **Flaw 1**: The reset condition `arst_i != ARST_LVL` assumes `arst_i` is active-low if `ARST_LVL` is 0. However, the spec states `ARST_LVL` can be configured (0 or 1). The assertion should directly use `arst_i == ARST_LVL` to detect active reset.  \n- **Flaw 2**: The assertion does not account for asynchronous reset behavior. `arst_i` can assert asynchronously, but the check is synchronized to `wb_clk_i`, missing transitions between clock edges.  \n- **Impact**: Fails to properly model asynchronous reset and uses inverted reset logic.  \n- **Score Impact**: -30 (incorrect reset condition and synchronization).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Functionality Assertion**\n```systemverilog\nproperty inta_functional;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  wb_inta_o == (ctr[1] && sr[4]);\nendproperty\nassert property (inta_functional);\n```\n- **Flaw 1**: The `disable iff` clause uses the same incorrect reset condition as the reset assertion (`arst_i != ARST_LVL` instead of `arst_i == ARST_LVL`).  \n- **Flaw 2**: The assertion assumes `wb_inta_o` updates immediately when `IEN` or `IF` changes. However, `wb_inta_o` is a registered output, so there may be a 1-cycle delay between `IEN/IF` changes and `wb_inta_o` reflecting them. The spec does not clarify this timing, making the assertion potentially overconstrained.  \n- **Impact**: Incorrect reset handling and possible timing mismatch.  \n- **Score Impact**: -20 (reset condition) -10 (timing assumption) = -30.\n\n---\n\n### **4. IACK Clear Assertion**\n```systemverilog\nproperty inta_iack_clear;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && (wb_adr_i == 3\'h4) && wb_dat_i[7]) |=> !wb_inta_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (inta_iack_clear);\n```\n- **Flaw 1**: The address `3\'h4` assumes a 3-bit address bus, but the spec uses addresses up to 0x04 (5 addresses), which requires at least 3 bits. This is correct but should explicitly reference the spec’s address mapping.  \n- **Flaw 2**: The assertion assumes `wb_inta_o` de-asserts **immediately** in the next cycle after writing `IACK`. However, the spec states that `IACK` clears the interrupt flag (`IF`), which in turn affects `wb_inta_o`. If `IF` is cleared in the same cycle as the `IACK` write, `wb_inta_o` would de-assert in the **same** cycle, not the next. The assertion’s `|=>` (next cycle) is incorrect.  \n- **Flaw 3**: The assertion does not check if `IEN` remains enabled. If `IEN` is disabled after `IACK`, `wb_inta_o` would de-assert regardless of `IF`, leading to a false positive.  \n- **Impact**: Incorrect timing for `IACK` effect and incomplete condition.  \n- **Score Impact**: -20 (timing) -10 (missing IEN check) = -30.\n\n---\n\n### **Other Flaws**\n1. **Clock Cycle Misinterpretation**:  \n   - All assertions use `posedge wb_clk_i` but do not account for potential setup/hold times or combinatorial delays in the design. For example, `wb_inta_o` might be updated combinatorially based on `IEN` and `IF`, but the spec states it is a registered output. This needs explicit confirmation.  \n   - **Impact**: Unclear timing assumptions. (-10)\n\n2. **Nested Conditions**:  \n   - The `IACK` assertion uses a long combinatorial condition (`wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && ...`). This is acceptable but could be simplified by referencing internal signals (e.g., `cr[7]`) if allowed. However, the problem restricts using only provided signals.  \n   - **Impact**: Minor readability issue. (-5)\n\n3. **Completeness**:  \n   - No check for glitches or spurious interrupts (e.g., `wb_inta_o` pulses when `IEN` or `IF` changes transiently).  \n   - **Impact**: Incomplete coverage.

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, I need to generate SVAs for the signal wb_inta_o based on the provided specification and the feedback from the previous attempt. Let's start by addressing the identified flaws and ensuring the assertions are correct, consistent, and complete.

First, the width assertion was using $bits in a dynamic property, which is incorrect. The width check should be a static compile-time check. So I'll replace the dynamic assertion with an initial block that checks the width once at simulation start.

Next, the reset connectivity assertion had issues with the reset condition and asynchronous handling. The original code used arst_i != ARST_LVL, but the correct condition should be arst_i == ARST_LVL to trigger the reset. Also, since arst_i is asynchronous, the property should include posedge arst_i in the sensitivity list to capture asynchronous resets properly.

For the functionality assertion, the disable iff clause was using the wrong reset condition. I'll correct it to arst_i == ARST_LVL. Also, since wb_inta_o is a registered output, there might be a one-cycle delay between the IEN/IF changing and the interrupt being asserted. So I'll adjust the assertion to check the interrupt in the next cycle after IEN and IF are set.

The IACK clear assertion had timing issues, assuming the interrupt clears in the next cycle. However, writing IACK should clear the IF bit immediately, so the interrupt should de-assert in the same cycle. I'll change the |=> to |-> to check the same cycle. Also, the address 3'h4 is correct as per the spec's register map, so no change there.

Additionally, I need to ensure that all assertions handle both synchronous and asynchronous resets correctly and that the disable iff clauses are properly structured.

Finally, I'll verify that no new signals are introduced and that all assertions strictly follow the specification without overcomplicating the conditions.

**[Verification]**
1. **Width Check**: Static `initial` assertion replaces incorrect dynamic check.
2. **Reset Handling**:  
   - Uses correct reset polarity (`arst_i == ARST_LVL`)  
   - Captures asynchronous reset with `posedge arst_i` sensitivity  
3. **Functionality**:  
   - Adds 1-cycle delay (`|=>`) to match registered output behavior  
   - Correct `disable iff` condition  
4. **IACK Clear**:  
   - Checks de-assertion in same cycle (`|->`) after valid command write  
   - Maintains spec-compliant address decoding (`3'h4` = Command reg)  

All assertions use only specified signals and strictly follow the specification.
