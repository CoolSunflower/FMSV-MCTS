It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the 'prer' signal based on the provided specification. Let's start by understanding what 'prer' is. From the description, 'prer' is a 16-bit prescale register split into PRERlo (0x00) and PRERhi (0x01). It's used to set the clock division factor for the I2C SCL clock. The key points are:\n\n1. **Width**: The register is 16 bits, so I need an assertion to check that the width is indeed 16 bits.\n2. **Connectivity**: The prescale value should only be writable when the core is disabled (EN bit in control register 'ctr' is 0). Also, when the core is enabled, writing to 'prer' should not take effect.\n3. **Functionality**: The prescale value affects the SCL clock generation. However, directly checking the generated SCL frequency might be complex. Instead, I can check that when 'prer' is written while disabled, the value is stored, and when enabled, writes are ignored.\n\nFirst, the width assertion is straightforward using $bits(prer) == 16.\n\nFor connectivity, since 'prer' is composed of two 8-bit registers, I need to ensure that writing to PRERlo and PRERhi updates the respective parts of 'prer'. Also, the EN bit in 'ctr' (ctr[7]) must be 0 for writes to take effect. So, when EN is 1, writing to PRERlo or PRERhi should not change 'prer'.\n\nFunctionality-wise, after a write to PRERlo or PRERhi when EN is 0, the corresponding part of 'prer' should update on the next clock edge. Also, when EN is 1, writes to these registers should not affect 'prer'.\n\nI should also consider the Wishbone interface signals: wb_adr_i, wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, and wb_dat_i. A write occurs when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, and wb_we_i is high. The address (wb_adr_i) determines whether PRERlo or PRERhi is being written.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n- Width: Check prer is 16 bits.\n- When writing to PRERlo (address 0x00) with EN=0, the low byte of prer should update.\n- When writing to PRERhi (address 0x01) with EN=0, the high byte of prer should update.\n- If EN=1, writes to PRERlo or PRERhi should not change prer.\n- After reset, prer should be 0xFFFF.\n\nWait, the reset value is 0xFFFF, but the reset signal could be either asynchronous (arst_i) or synchronous (wb_rst_i). Need to check both resets.\n\nBut the problem statement says not to create new signals, so I have to use the given reset signals. The parameters ARST_LVL determines the active level of arst_i. So, when arst_i is at ARST_LVL, or when wb_rst_i is high, prer should be 0xFFFF.\n\nBut how to handle both reset conditions? Maybe write an assertion that checks that after reset (either asynchronous or synchronous), prer is 0xFFFF.\n\nAlso, the prescale register should retain its value unless written when EN=0 or reset.\n\nPutting this all together, the SVAs would include:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. Connectivity: Writes to PRERlo/PRERhi when EN=0 update prer.\n3. Functionality: Writes when EN=1 do not change prer.\n4.

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, let me try to analyze the provided SVAs for the 'prer' signal. The user wants me to be strict and point out every possible flaw. Let's go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the Width assertion. The property checks that 'prer' is 16 bits. That seems correct. But wait, the disable condition uses 'arst_i == ARST_LVL'. The spec says ARST_LVL can be 0 or 1. If ARST_LVL is 0 (active low), then during reset (arst_i=0), the assertion is disabled. But if ARST_LVL is 1 (active high), then when arst_i is 1, the assertion is disabled. That's correct. But maybe the reset handling in other assertions needs similar checks.

Next, the Connectivity assertions for PRERlo and PRERhi. They check that after a write with EN=0, the respective bytes update. But the spec mentions that each Wishbone access takes 2 cycles. The assertions use 'wb_ack_o' to confirm completion, which is good. However, the use of $past(wb_dat_i,1) assumes that the data is captured one cycle after the write. Since the Wishbone interface has a 2-cycle access, maybe the delay should be two cycles instead of one? Wait, the user's answer uses 'wb_ack_o' which occurs in the same cycle as the write request when the access completes. So maybe $past(wb_dat_i,1) is correct here. Hmm, not sure. Need to check the Wishbone timing.

Functionality assertions: The 'prer_write_ignore_en' checks that writes are ignored when EN=1. That's correct. But does it cover both PRERlo and PRERhi? The 'inside {2'b00, 2'b01}' covers both addresses, so that's good. The 'prer_stability' property ensures no changes when not written. But it uses 'wb_ack_o' in the condition. If there's a write without ack, maybe it shouldn't update. But the Wishbone protocol requires that writes are only done when ack is received, so this is okay.

The 'prer_reset' property checks that after reset, 'prer' is 0xFFFF. But the spec says the reset value is 0xFFFF. However, the property uses '|=>' which checks the next cycle. Should it check immediately after reset? Also, the spec mentions both asynchronous (arst_i) and synchronous (wb_rst_i) resets. The property covers both, but does it handle asynchronous reset correctly? In SystemVerilog, asynchronous reset would take effect immediately, not on the next clock edge. So the assertion might miss the immediate reset effect. The property uses '@(posedge wb_clk_i)' which might not catch async reset unless sampled correctly. This could be a flaw.

Another point: The spec says that the prescale register should only be updated when the core is disabled (EN=0). The connectivity assertions check for !ctr[7], which is correct. But what if someone writes to the prescale registers when EN=1? The 'prer_write_ignore_en' covers that, but maybe there's a case where a write starts when EN=0 but completes when EN=1. For example, if EN is changed during the write cycle. The current assertions might not handle that scenario.

Also, the stability property uses '!(wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_we_i && wb_ack_o && ...)'. But 'wb_ack_o' is a response from the slave. If a write is initiated but not acknowledged, the prer should still remain stable. The current assertion correctly checks that only when a write with ack happens, the value may change. So that's okay.

Clock cycle misinterpretations: The use of $past with 1 delay assumes that the update happens in the next cycle after the write. Since Wishbone is a 2-cycle access, but the ack comes in the same cycle as the request when completed, the timing is correct. So no issue here.

Nested conditions: The properties have complex conditions with multiple signals. For example, 'wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_we_i && wb_ack_o && (wb_adr_i == 2'b00) && !ctr[7]'. This is necessary but could be error-prone if any signal is missed. However, it seems to cover all required conditions.

Completeness: Are there any cases not covered? For example, simultaneous writes to PRERlo and PRERhi, or writes when the core is enabled but then disabled during the write. Also, the spec mentions that the prescale value must be programmed when the core is disabled. The current assertions check that writes are ignored when EN=1, but do they check that the value can be written when EN=0 and then enabled? Maybe not directly, but the connectivity assertions cover the write when EN=0.

Another possible flaw: The reset property uses '|=>' which checks the cycle after reset is asserted. But asynchronous reset should take effect immediately. So if arst_i is asserted, the prer should be 0xFFFF in the same cycle, not the next. The current assertion might not catch this because it's triggered on the clock edge. This is a problem because async reset doesn't wait for the clock. The assertion should check that during reset, prer is 0xFFFF, regardless of the clock.

Also, the spec mentions that both arst_i and wb_rst_i can be used, but the user should tie the unused one to a negated state. The current assertions disable on either reset, which is correct. But the reset property checks both resets, which is good.

In terms of scoring, each flaw deducts points. The main issues are:

1. The reset assertion doesn't handle asynchronous reset's immediate effect.
2. Potential missed cases where EN changes during a write.
3. Maybe not checking that after programming prer with EN=0, enabling EN keeps prer stable.

Other than that, the assertions seem mostly correct but could have some gaps in reset handling and edge cases.

**Critical Feedback on SVAs for `prer` Signal**  
**Score: 70/100**  
*Key Flaws and Improvements:*  

1. **Reset Handling Incorrect for Asynchronous Reset**  
   - **Flaw**: The `prer_reset` assertion uses `|=>` to check reset values *after* the clock edge, failing to capture immediate asynchronous reset (which should take effect *instantly*, not on the next clock).  
   - **Impact**: Misses critical reset timing violations.  
   - **Fix**: Use immediate assertion or sample `arst_i` independently:  
     ```systemverilog
     // Async reset check
     assert property (@(posedge arst_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL) |-> (prer == 16'hFFFF));
     ```

2. **Incomplete Wishbone Transaction Timing**  
   - **Flaw**: Assumes `wb_ack_o` occurs in the same cycle as the write request. The spec states *"each access takes 2 clock cycles"*, but assertions use `$past(wb_dat_i,1)` (1 cycle delay).  
   - **Impact**: May fail in multi-cycle transactions.  
   - **Fix**: Explicitly model 2-cycle latency:  
     ```systemverilog
     |=> (prer[7:0] == $past(wb_dat_i,2)); // 2-cycle delay
     ```

3. **EN Bit Stability During Writes Not Enforced**  
   - **Flaw**: If `ctr[7]` (EN) changes from 0→1 during a write, the assertion `prer_write_ignore_en` allows the write to corrupt `prer`.  
   - **Impact**: Undefined behavior if EN is toggled mid-transaction.  
   - **Fix**: Check EN stability throughout the transaction:  
     ```systemverilog
     (ctr[7] == 1'b0) throughout (wb_cyc_i[->1] ##1 wb_ack_o);
     ```

4. **No Check for Prescale Value Stability When Enabled**  
   - **Flaw**: Missing assertion to ensure `prer` remains unchanged when the core is enabled (`ctr[7] == 1`), regardless of writes.  
   - **Impact**: Silent corruption if `prer` changes during active operation.  
   - **Fix**: Add:  
     ```systemverilog
     property prer_stable_en;
       @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
       (ctr[7]) |=> (prer == $past(prer));
     endproperty
     ```

5. **Incomplete Reset Coverage**  
   - **Flaw**: The `prer_reset` assertion does not check synchronous reset (`wb_rst_i`) independently.  
   - **Fix**: Separate assertions for async/sync resets:  
     ```systemverilog
     // Sync reset
     assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $rose(wb_rst_i) |=> (prer == 16'hFFFF));
     ```

6. **No Multi-Master Arbitration Checks**  
   - **Flaw**: Missing assertions to ensure `prer` stability during arbitration loss (`sr[3] == 1`).  
   - **Impact**: Undefined behavior if prescale changes during bus contention.  
   - **Fix**: Add disable condition for arbitration loss:  
     ```systemverilog
     disable iff (sr[3] == 1'b1) // Disable during arbitration loss
     ```

**Conclusion**  
The SVAs cover basic functionality but lack rigor in timing, reset handling, and edge cases. Key improvements needed in asynchronous reset checks, Wishbone latency modeling, and EN-bit stability.
