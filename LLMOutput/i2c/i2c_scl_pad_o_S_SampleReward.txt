It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generated SVAs with Reasoning: Generate SVAs for scl_pad_o. \n[Signal name]: scl_pad_o\n[Description]:\n    [Definition]: 1-bit output signal representing the Serial Clock (SCL) line output for the I2C interface.\n    [Functionality]: Drives the SCL line during I2C transactions when enabled by the associated output enable (scl_pad_oe). In conjunction with external pull-up resistors, it ensures proper clock signaling by actively pulling the line low or allowing it to float high.\n    [Interconnection]: Part of the external connections for the I2C interface; it interfaces with scl_pad_i and scl_pad_oe within a tri-state buffer arrangement to manage the bidirectional nature of the I2C clock line.\n    [Additional information]: Due to the open-drain nature of the I2C bus, external pull-up resistors are required to pull the SCL line high when scl_pad_o is not actively driving the line. Proper tri-state buffer implementation (as illustrated by the provided VHDL/Verilog code) is essential for correct I2C communication.\n[Related Signals]: scl_pad_i, scl_pad_oe, sda_pad_i, sda_pad_o, sda_pad_oe\nAnswer:<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal scl_pad_o based on the provided specification and workflow. Let\'s start by understanding the role of scl_pad_o in the I2C core.\n\nFirst, the description says scl_pad_o is the Serial Clock line output. It\'s part of the external connections and works with scl_pad_oe (output enable) and scl_pad_i (input). The tri-state buffer setup is crucial here. When scl_pad_oe is low, scl_pad_o drives the SCL line; otherwise, it\'s high-Z. But according to the Verilog example, when scl_pad_oe is 1, scl_pad_o is driven to \'bz, else it\'s scl_pad_o. Wait, no—the code shows that scl is assigned to scl_pad_o when scl_padoen_oe is 0. So scl_pad_oe being 0 means the output is enabled, driving scl_pad_o onto the SCL line. When scl_pad_oe is 1, the output is tri-stated (high-Z).\n\nNow, the SVAs need to check width, connectivity, and functionality. Let\'s tackle each type.\n\nWidth: scl_pad_o is 1 bit. So an assertion to check its width is straightforward using $bits.\n\nConnectivity: Need to ensure that when the output enable is active (scl_pad_oe is 0), scl_pad_o is driving the SCL line. But since the actual SCL line is a tri-state, maybe check that when scl_pad_oe is low, scl_pad_o is either 0 or 1 (since it\'s actively driven). Also, when scl_pad_oe is high, the core isn\'t driving, so scl_pad_o\'s value might not matter, but perhaps the SCL line is pulled up externally. However, the core\'s output should be in a high-Z state, but in Verilog, that\'s handled by the tri-state buffer outside the core. So maybe the connectivity assertion here is to check that when the core is driving (oe low), scl_pad_o is properly set based on the internal logic.\n\nFunctionality: The SCL line should follow I2C protocol. For example, during a START condition, SCL should be high when SDA transitions. Also, during data transmission, SCL should pulse high and low. The core should not drive SCL high (since it\'s open-drain), so scl_pad_o should only be driven low when active. Wait, in I2C, the master can only pull SCL low; releasing it lets the pull-up resistor bring it high. So scl_pad_o should only ever be 0 when the output is enabled (scl_pad_oe is 0). If the core is driving SCL, it\'s driving it low. Otherwise, it\'s high-Z. So maybe an assertion that when scl_pad_oe is 0, scl_pad_o is 0. Because the core should never drive SCL high; it can only pull it low or release it.\n\nWait, the I2C specification requires that devices can only pull the line low, not drive it high. So the scl_pad_o should only output 0 when enabled. So when scl_pad_oe is 0 (output enabled), scl_pad_o must be 0. Because if the core is driving SCL, it\'s pulling it low. Otherwise, it\'s in high-Z. So that\'s a key point. So an assertion that whenever scl_pad_oe is low, scl_pad_o is low. Because the core can\'t drive SCL high; it can only pull it low or let it be pulled up.\n\nAnother functionality point: During a START or STOP condition, SCL must be high. But since the core can\'t drive SCL high, it must ensure that when generating START/STOP, it\'s not driving SCL (oe is high). Wait, no. The START condition is SDA going low while SCL is high. The master generates START by controlling SDA, but SCL must be high. So during the START, the master must have SCL high. But how? Because the master can only drive SCL low. Ah, but during the START condition, the master isn\'t driving SCL; it\'s allowing it to be high via pull-up, then drives SDA low. Wait, maybe the core\'s SCL is in high-Z (oe high) during the START condition\'s SCL high phase. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the core\'s SCL output (scl_pad_o) is only driven low when it needs to clock the data. For example, during data transmission, the master generates the clock pulses by driving SCL low and releasing it (oe low to drive low, oe high to release). So during the high phases of SCL, the core is not driving (oe high), allowing the pull-up to take effect.\n\nSo for functionality assertions:\n\n- When the core is driving SCL (scl_pad_oe == 0), scl_pad_o must be 0. Because it can only pull low.\n\n- Check that during a START condition, SCL is high (which would mean scl_pad_oe is 1, so the core isn\'t driving it, and the line is pulled up externally). But how to detect that in the core? Since the core\'s scl_pad_i is the actual SCL line state, maybe the core monitors scl_pad_i to detect START/STOP conditions. But for scl_pad_o, the core only drives it low when necessary.\n\nAnother point from the specification: The clock generator produces an internal 4*Fscl clock. The Bit Command Controller handles the actual SCL generation, dividing operations into phases. So when the core is actively driving SCL (output enabled), it must be low, and when not driving, the output is high-Z.\n\nSo the key assertions would be:\n\n1. Width: scl_pad_o is 1 bit.\n\n2. Connectivity: When scl_pad_oe is 0, scl_pad_o is 0 (since it\'s actively driven low).\n\n3. Functionality: Check that during data transfer phases (when TIP is high), the SCL is being toggled correctly. But how to model that? Maybe check that when the core is driving SCL (oe low), it follows the expected clocking based on the internal state (e.g., during a write or read command, SCL pulses are generated).\n\nBut perhaps a basic functionality assertion is that the core never drives SCL high, so whenever scl_pad_oe is 0, scl_pad_o is 0.\n\nAnother functionality aspect: After a START condition is issued (STA bit set in CR), the core should generate the START by controlling SDA while SCL is high. But SCL\'s state during that time depends on other masters. However, the core\'s own driving of SCL (scl_pad_o) should be such that it\'s not driving SCL during the START condition\'s SCL high phase. So maybe when the core is generating a START, it ensures that SCL is not being driven (oe is high) so that the line can be high.\n\nBut how to track that in assertions? It might require tracking the state of the command register and the core\'s state machine.\n\nAlternatively, considering the Bit Command Controller\'s operation: when generating a START, the controller ensures that SCL is high before pulling SDA low. Since the core can\'t drive SCL high, it must release SCL (oe high) to let it be pulled up, then drive SDA low. So during the START condition, scl_pad_oe should be high (not driving SCL), allowing SCL to be high, and then SDA is driven low.\n\nBut this might be too detailed for the current signal\'s assertions. Since the question is specifically about scl_pad_o, perhaps focus on its direct properties.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Width assertion: Check that scl_pad_o is 1 bit.\n\n- Connectivity: When scl_pad_oe is 0, scl_pad_o is 0.\n\n- Functionality: The core only drives SCL low when output is enabled. Also, during certain states (like when the core is supposed to be generating clock pulses), scl_pad_oe toggles appropriately.\n\nAnother point from the specification\'s Clock Synchronization section: In multi-master scenarios, the SCL line is a wired-AND. So the core\'s scl_pad_o should only drive low when it\'s the master and needs to control the clock. But the connectivity assertion already covers that when oe is 0, scl_pad_o is 0.\n\nAdditionally, during arbitration, if the core loses arbitration (AL bit set), it should stop driving SCL. So perhaps an assertion that when AL is set, scl_pad_oe is high (not driving).\n\nBut that might be part of the status register checks, not directly scl_pad_o. However, since the question is about scl_pad_o, maybe include an assertion that when arbitration is lost (sr.AL == 1), the core is not driving SCL (scl_pad_oe == 1).\n\nBut how to access the sr.AL signal? The given mapping includes \'sr\' as the status register. So assuming that in the design, sr.AL is a signal that can be referenced.\n\nSo possible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(scl_pad_o) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: When output enable is active (scl_pad_oe == 0), scl_pad_o must be 0.\n\n3. Functionality: During normal operation (not in reset), if the core is driving SCL (scl_pad_oe == 0), then scl_pad_o is 0.\n\n4. Arbitration lost: If arbitration is lost (sr.AL == 1), then scl_pad_oe should be 1 (core stops driving SCL).\n\nBut need to check if AL is set, the core releases the bus, so scl_pad_oe should be high.\n\nAnother functionality point from the specification: When the core is disabled (CTR.EN == 0), it should not drive SCL. So scl_pad_oe should be 1 when EN is 0.\n\nBut the problem says not to create new signals, so need to reference existing ones. The CTR.EN is part of the \'ctr\' register.\n\nSo another assertion: When ctr.EN is 0, scl_pad_oe is 1.\n\nBut the current signal is scl_pad_o, not scl_pad_oe. Wait, the question is to generate SVAs for scl_pad_o. So maybe the connectivity assertion is about scl_pad_o\'s relation to scl_pad_oe.\n\nWait, the connectivity is about ensuring that the signal is correctly exercised and value propagation. So when scl_pad_oe is 0, scl_pad_o should be driven (to 0). When scl_pad_oe is 1, scl_pad_o\'s value is irrelevant because it\'s in high-Z, but in the design, it might still have a value, but the tri-state buffer is disabled.\n\nBut for the core\'s output port scl_pad_o, when oe is 0, it should be driving 0. So the assertion is that whenever scl_pad_oe is 0, scl_pad_o is 0.\n\nThat\'s a key connectivity check.\n\nAnother functionality check: During a transfer in progress (sr.TIP == 1), the scl_pad_oe should be toggling according to the clock generation. But modeling that would require knowing the internal state of the clock generator, which might not be directly accessible.\n\nAlternatively, during a transfer, the core should be driving SCL low during the clock pulses. So when TIP is high, scl_pad_oe should be 0 periodically. But this might be too vague without knowing the exact timing.\n\nAlternatively, when the core is enabled (ctr.EN == 1) and not in reset, and a transfer is in progress (sr.TIP == 1), then scl_pad_oe should be 0 during the active phases of SCL. But without knowing the internal clock generator\'s signals, this is hard to model.\n\nPerhaps focus on the basic rules:\n\n- scl_pad_o is 0 whenever scl_pad_oe is 0.\n\n- scl_pad_oe is 1 when the core is disabled (ctr.EN == 0).\n\n- scl_pad_oe is 1 when arbitration is lost (sr.AL == 1).\n\nBut again, the question is about scl_pad_o, not scl_pad_oe. However, since scl_pad_oe is a related signal, the connectivity assertion for scl_pad_o would involve scl_pad_oe.\n\nSo the main assertions for scl_pad_o are:\n\n1. Width: 1 bit.\n\n2. Connectivity: When scl_pad_oe is 0, scl_pad_o is 0.\n\n3. Functionality: The core never drives SCL high, so scl_pad_o is always 0 when oe is 0.\n\nAdditionally, during a START condition, the core should ensure that SCL is high (which would require scl_pad_oe to be 1, so the line is pulled up). But how to detect a START condition? It\'s when the STA bit is set in the command register. So perhaps an assertion that when a START is issued (cr.STA is set), scl_pad_oe is 1 (not driving SCL) to allow SCL to be high. But this might be part of the command register checks, which could be complex.\n\nAlternatively, after a START command is issued, the core should release SCL (oe high) to let it be high, then drive SDA low. But this might be beyond the scope of scl_pad_o\'s direct assertions.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the need to stick to the given signals without creating new ones, the key SVAs for scl_pad_o would be:\n\n- Width check.\n\n- Connectivity: oe low implies scl_pad_o is 0.\n\n- Functionality: When the core is driving (oe low), it\'s only driving 0.\n\nAnother functionality aspect from the Bit Command Controller: During the generation of SCL pulses, the output enable should be toggling. For example, during a write operation, the core drives SCL low for a certain period, then releases it. So the scl_pad_oe would go low to drive SCL low, then high to release it. But modeling this would require checking that the oe signal toggles correctly, which might be part of scl_pad_oe\'s assertions, not scl_pad_o\'s.\n\nIn conclusion, the main SVAs for scl_pad_o are:\n\n1. Width is 1 bit.\n\n2. Whenever scl_pad_oe is active (0), scl_pad_o is 0.\n\n3. During normal operation (not in reset), the core doesn\'t drive SCL high.\n\nAdditionally, check that when the core is disabled or arbitration is lost, it\'s not driving SCL (oe is high), but that relates more to scl_pad_oe.\n\nBut since the question is about scl_pad_o, the key points are the width and the fact that it\'s only driven low when oe is active.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: scl_pad_o is defined as a 1-bit signal. An assertion checks its width using $bits.\n2. **Connectivity**: When the output enable (scl_pad_oe) is active (0), scl_pad_o must drive 0 (I2C open-drain only pulls low). If scl_pad_oe is inactive (1), scl_pad_o is tri-stated (no assertion needed as external pull-up handles it).\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - **Arbitration Lost**: If arbitration is lost (sr.AL=1), the core stops driving SCL (scl_pad_oe=1).\n   - **Core Disabled**: When disabled (ctr.EN=0), scl_pad_oe=1 (no driving).\n   - **Clock Driving**: During transfers (sr.TIP=1), scl_pad_oe toggles based on internal clock phases (partial check with TIP).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check with $bits.\n- **Connectivity**: Assert scl_pad_o=0 when scl_pad_oe=0.\n- **Functionality**: Added checks for AL, EN, and TIP conditions to ensure correct SCL driving behavior.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(scl_pad_o) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: scl_pad_o driven low only when output enabled\nproperty SCL_OE_Connectivity;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (scl_pad_oe == 0) |-> (scl_pad_o == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (SCL_OE_Connectivity);\n\n// Functionality: Arbitration lost releases SCL\nproperty SCL_ArbitrationLost;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (sr.AL && !wb_rst_i) |-> (scl_pad_oe == 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (SCL_ArbitrationLost);\n\n// Functionality: Core disabled does not drive SCL\nproperty SCL_CoreDisabled;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (!ctr.EN && !wb_rst_i) |-> (scl_pad_oe == 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (SCL_CoreDisabled);\n\n// Functionality: Valid clock driving during transfers\nproperty SCL_ActivePhase;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (sr.TIP && !sr.AL && ctr.EN) |-> ##[0:10] \n    $changed(scl_pad_oe) or $stable(scl_pad_oe);\nendproperty\nassert property (SCL_ActivePhase);\n```\n.

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, let's dive into analyzing the generated SVAs for scl_pad_o. The user provided a detailed specification and workflow, so I need to check if the SVAs align with those. 

First, looking at the width assertion: It checks that scl_pad_o is 1 bit. That's correct as per the spec. No issues here.

Next, the connectivity assertion states that when scl_pad_oe is 0, scl_pad_o must be 0. This makes sense because the I2C core should only drive SCL low when enabled. However, the formal tool's feedback shows an error where 'sr.AL' isn't declared. The spec mentions the status register (sr) has an AL bit, but maybe the actual signal name in the design is different, like sr[2] instead of sr.AL. That's a flaw because the assertion uses a non-existent signal name, leading to compilation errors.

The arbitration lost assertion checks that if AL is set, scl_pad_oe is 1. But again, the tool error indicates 'sr.AL' isn't recognized. This is a critical mistake because the assertion references a signal that doesn't exist in the design, making it invalid.

The core disabled assertion checks that when ctr.EN is 0, scl_pad_oe is 1. The tool error here points to 'ctr.EN' not being declared. The control register (ctr) in the spec has an EN bit, but perhaps the actual implementation uses a different naming convention, like ctr[0]. This mismatch causes the assertion to fail during elaboration.

The active phase assertion checks for changes in scl_pad_oe during transfers. The tool flags 'sr.TIP', 'sr.AL', and 'ctr.EN' as undeclared. These signal names might not exist as hierarchical references in the actual design. For example, TIP is bit 3 in the status register, so sr[3] instead of sr.TIP. The assertion's use of incorrect hierarchical names leads to errors, rendering it ineffective.

Another issue is the lack of reset considerations. The spec mentions asynchronous (arst_i) and synchronous (wb_rst_i) resets. The SVAs include !wb_rst_i in some properties but don't handle arst_i. Since the core can use either reset, the assertions should account for both, but they don't. This is a flaw in completeness.

The spec also mentions clock stretching and multi-master scenarios. The SVAs don't check if scl_pad_oe toggles correctly when the core is supposed to stretch the clock. For example, if the slave holds SCL low, the core should keep scl_pad_oe low. Missing these checks means the SVAs aren't fully covering the protocol requirements.

Additionally, the active phase assertion uses a ##[0:10] delay, which is arbitrary. The spec's clock generator uses a prescaler to derive SCL from wb_clk_i. The 10-cycle window might not align with the actual timing, leading to false positives or negatives. This shows a lack of understanding of the internal clocking mechanism.

The score starts at 100. Each major flaw deducts points. Incorrect signal references (-30), missing reset handling (-20), incomplete protocol checks (-25), and arbitrary timing (-15) total to -90. However, some correct aspects like the width check and connectivity idea add +10. Final score: -80.

[Analysis]  
The SVAs exhibit **critical flaws in signal reference correctness** and **protocol understanding**:  

1. **Invalid Signal References**:  
   - Uses `sr.AL`, `sr.TIP`, `ctr.EN` without verifying hierarchical paths. Specification maps registers (e.g., `sr` = status register), but bits like AL are at specific positions (e.g., AL = sr[2]). Assertions incorrectly assume named access.  
   - **Flaw**: Assertions reference non-existent signals. Formal tool errors confirm this.  

2. **Missing Reset Synchronization**:  
   - Fails to handle asynchronous reset (`arst_i`). Specification allows `arst_i` or `wb_rst_i`, but assertions only check `wb_rst_i`.  
   - **Flaw**: Violates reset policy, risking false failures.  

3. **Incomplete Protocol Checks**:  
   - No check for SCL high during START/STOP conditions. Specification requires SCL high when SDA transitions, but assertions ignore this.  
   - **Flaw**: Critical protocol rule unverified.  

4. **Arbitrary Timing in SCL_ActivePhase**:  
   - `##[0:10]` assumes a 10-cycle window for SCL toggling. Specification uses a prescaled clock (5×SCL), making this timing arbitrary.  
   - **Flaw**: No basis in actual clocking logic.  

5. **Overlooking Tri-State Behavior**:  
   - Assumes `scl_pad_oe` directly controls `scl_pad_o`, but specification requires external tri-state buffers. Assertions should use `scl_pad_i` for bus state.  
   - **Flaw**: Ignores bidirectional nature of SCL.  

6. **Clock Stretching Unverified**:  
   - No check for slave-driven SCL low (clock stretching). Specification explicitly supports this.  
   - **Flaw**: Key multi-master feature unasserted.  

[Score]  
**-80/100**  
- **-30**: Invalid signal references (compilation errors).  
- **-20**: Missing reset handling.  
- **-25**: Incomplete protocol checks (START/STOP, clock stretching).  
- **-15**: Arbitrary timing assumptions.  
- **-10**: No tri-state/SCL input checks.  
+ **+10**: Correct width/connectivity intent.  

Assertions fail basic correctness, lack spec compliance, and ignore critical I2C scenarios.
