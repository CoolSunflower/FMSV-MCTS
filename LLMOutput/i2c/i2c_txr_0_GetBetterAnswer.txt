It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

The Byte Command Controller tells the Bit Command Controller\nwhich operation has to be performed. For a single byte read, the Bit Command Controller\nreceives 8 separate read commands. Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the txr signal based on the provided specification. Let\'s start by understanding what txr does.\n\nFirst, the txr is an 8-bit write-only register at address 0x03. Its bits 7:1 hold the next byte to transmit, and bit 0 is either the data\'s LSB or the R/W bit. The reset value is 0x00. It\'s connected to the WISHBONE interface and interacts with the DataIO Shift Register, CR, and SR.\n\nFor SVAs, I need to cover width, connectivity, and functionality checks.\n\nWidth assertion: Check that txr is always 8 bits wide. That\'s straightforward using $bits(txr) == 8.\n\nConnectivity: Since txr is write-only via WISHBONE, I should check that when the WISHBONE interface writes to address 0x03 with wb_we_i high, txr gets the data from wb_dat_i. Also, ensure that during a write operation (when WR bit in CR is set), the DataIO Shift Register loads txr\'s value. But the DataIO Shift Register isn\'t a signal here, so maybe focus on the WISHBONE interaction.\n\nFunctionality: When a write command (WR bit in CR) is issued, txr\'s value should be correctly used. For example, during a slave address transfer, bit 0 should be the R/W bit. But how to check that? Maybe when the core is in address phase (STA set, WR set), txr[0] should be 0 or 1. Also, after writing to txr and setting WR, the TIP in SR should be set until the transfer completes. However, the exact timing might depend on other signals.\n\nWait, the Command Register (CR) has WR and RD bits. When WR is set, the core should transmit the txr value. So an assertion could check that when WR is set, txr holds the correct data that\'s being sent. But how to track that? Maybe after a write to txr and WR is set, the DataIO Shift Register (not a signal here) would have that data. Since we can\'t reference internal registers, maybe check that when a write to CR with WR occurs, the txr has been written previously or simultaneously.\n\nAlso, since txr is write-only, any read from it via WISHBONE should not affect it, but the specification says it\'s write-only, so reads would be from another register. But the WISHBONE interface handles that, so maybe no SVA needed here.\n\nAnother point: After reset, txr should be 0x00. So an assertion that after reset, txr == 0.\n\nBut the reset could be asynchronous (arst_i) or synchronous (wb_rst_i). Need to check both conditions.\n\nConnectivity-wise, when the WISHBONE writes to address 0x03 (txr\'s address), with wb_we_i high, wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i high, then on the next clock edge, txr should take wb_dat_i. So an assertion that when a write transaction to txr occurs, txr updates accordingly.\n\nFunctionality: When a WR command is issued (CR\'s WR bit set), the txr\'s value should remain stable until the transfer starts. But how to track that? Maybe during the TIP (transfer in progress), txr shouldn\'t change, but the spec says that the user can write a new value once TIP is cleared. So when TIP is high, txr should not be written again. But that\'s more of a protocol check, perhaps covered by another assertion.\n\nAlso, during a slave address transfer, txr\'s bit 0 is the R/W bit. So if the core is sending an address (after a START), then txr[7:1] should be the slave address, and txr[0] the R/W direction. But how to detect that the core is in the address phase? It might require tracking the state machine, which isn\'t directly exposed. Maybe this is too internal and can\'t be checked without more info.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check txr is 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity: WISHBONE write to txr updates the register.\n3. Functionality: After reset, txr is 0. When WR is set, txr holds the data being sent (but how to verify it\'s transmitted? Maybe via the DataIO Shift Register, which isn\'t a signal here. Maybe this part is not feasible without internal signals.)\n4. Check that during a transfer (TIP high), txr isn\'t written again.\n5. When a slave address is sent (STA and WR set), txr[0] is the R/W bit (0 or 1), but since both are valid, maybe just check it\'s 0 or 1.\n\nBut the problem states not to create new signals, so I can\'t reference internal states like address phase. So maybe focus on what\'s observable.\n\nPossible SVAs:\n\n- Width: assert property ($bits(txr) == 8);\n- Connectivity: When WISHBONE writes to txr\'s address, txr gets the data.\n- Functionality: After reset, txr is 0. When WR is set in CR, txr remains stable until TIP goes low (but need to check if TIP is high during transfer).\n\nWait, the Status Register (SR) has TIP bit. So when TIP is high (transfer in progress), the txr should not be written again until TIP is low. But the user should not write during TIP, so an assertion could check that if TIP is high, txr doesn\'t change unless a WISHBONE write occurs, which it shouldn\'t. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, when a write to txr occurs while TIP is high, it might be invalid. But the spec says the user should wait until TIP is low. So an assertion could check that during TIP, no writes to txr happen.\n\nBut the WISHBONE interface allows writes anytime, but the core might ignore them during TIP. The spec says "The user may issue a new write or read command when the TIP flag is reset." So if the user writes to txr while TIP is high, it\'s possibly an error. But the core might latch the txr value only when the WR command is issued. So maybe the assertion is that when WR is set in CR, txr must have been written while TIP was low.\n\nAlternatively, when the WR bit is set (in CR), txr should have been written in the same cycle or prior. But since CR and txr are different registers, the user would write txr first, then CR. So maybe when WR is set, txr holds the value that was written before.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe focus on the connectivity and width, and basic functionality like reset value.\n\nSo the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. Connectivity: WISHBONE write to txr updates the register.\n3. Reset value check.\n4. When WR is set, txr is stable during the transfer.\n\nBut how to express that? Let\'s draft them.\n\nWidth:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (1\'b1) |-> ($bits(txr) == 8));\n\nConnectivity:\n\nWhen wb_adr_i is 0x03 (txr\'s address), wb_we_i is high, wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, then on the next clock, txr should be wb_dat_i.\n\nproperty TXR_Write;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_we_i && (wb_adr_i == 3\'h03)) |=> (txr == $past(wb_dat_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (TXR_Write);\n\nReset value:\n\nAfter reset (arst_i or wb_rst_i), txr should be 0.\n\nproperty TXR_Reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |=> (txr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (TXR_Reset);\n\nFunctionality: When WR is set in CR, txr remains stable until the transfer starts. But since the transfer starts when WR is set, maybe check that during the cycle when WR is set, txr doesn\'t change until TIP is set.\n\nAlternatively, when the WR command is issued (CR.WR is set), the txr value should not change until the transfer completes (TIP goes low). But how to track that? Because once WR is set, the core processes the command, and TIP goes high. So during TIP high, the user shouldn\'t write to txr again. But the assertion would check that if TIP is high, txr doesn\'t change unless there\'s a new write.\n\nBut the user could write to txr again while TIP is high, but the core might not use it until the next WR command. So maybe the assertion is that when TIP is high, any write to txr is held until TIP goes low. But without internal signals, it\'s hard to track.\n\nAlternatively, when the WR bit is set, the txr value at that time is captured, and during the transfer (TIP high), txr should remain the same. But how to check that? Because the user might write to txr again, but the core is using the previous value.\n\nThis might be too complex without internal signals. Maybe skip this part or find another angle.\n\nAnother functionality point: When a slave address is sent (STA and WR set), txr[0] is the R/W bit. But since the R/W bit can be 0 or 1, the assertion can check that txr[0] is either 0 or 1 when STA and WR are set. But how to trigger this? When CR.STA and CR.WR are set, check txr[0] is 0 or 1.\n\nBut CR.STA and CR.WR are in the Command Register. So when those bits are written, check txr\'s bit 0.\n\nBut the user writes to CR and txr in separate cycles. So when CR.STA and CR.WR are set, the txr should have been written beforehand. The assertion would need to check that at the time WR is set, txr[0] is valid.\n\nBut how to capture that? Maybe when the WR bit is set in CR, txr[0] is 0 or 1.\n\nproperty TXR_RW_Bit_Valid;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)\n  $rose(cr[2] /* WR bit */) |-> (txr[0] == 0 || txr[0] == 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (TXR_RW_Bit_Valid);\n\nBut the CR bits are write-only and cleared automatically. So when WR is set, it\'s only high for one cycle. So using $rose(cr[2]) would capture the rising edge when WR is written.\n\nThis checks that whenever the WR command is issued, the txr\'s bit 0 is a valid R/W value (0 or 1).\n\nAnother functionality: After writing to txr and issuing a WR command, the TIP bit should go high, indicating a transfer in progress. But this involves interaction between txr, CR, and SR, which might be covered in another SVA for CR or SR.\n\nIn conclusion, the main SVAs for txr are:\n\n1. Width check.\n2.

The spec states txr is 8-bit. No issues here.\n\n2. **Connectivity (WISHBONE Write)**:\n   - **Provided SVA**: Asserts that a WISHBONE write to address 0x03 updates txr with `wb_dat_i` in the next cycle.\n   - **Flaws**:\n     - **Missing Reset Condition**: The `disable iff` clause includes `wb_rst_i` and `arst_i`, but the spec mentions `arst_i` is asynchronous and level-sensitive (ARST_LVL). The assertion should check `arst_i == ARST_LVL` instead of just `arst_i`.\n     - **Incomplete Address Check**: The spec uses 3-bit addressing (registers at 0x00-0x05). Address 0x03 is `3\'h03`, which is correct. No issue here.\n     - **Timing**: Uses `|=>`, which checks the next cycle. Correct, since WISHBONE writes take 2 cycles, but the core’s outputs are registered. However, the spec says "each access takes 2 clock cycles," so the txr update might take 2 cycles. The assertion assumes it updates in 1 cycle, which could be incorrect.\n\n3. **Reset Value Check**:\n   - **Provided SVA**: Checks txr == 0x00 after reset.\n   - **Flaws**:\n     - **Asynchronous Reset Handling**: Uses `arst_i == ARST_LVL`, which is correct. However, the `|=>` assumes the reset is de-asserted in the next cycle. If the reset is still active, txr should remain 0x00. The assertion only checks the cycle after reset assertion, not during sustained reset.\n\n4. **Valid R/W Bit When WR Command Issued**:\n   - **Provided SVA**: Checks that when `cr[2]` (WR bit) rises, `txr[0]` is 0 or 1.\n   - **Flaws**:\n     - **Incorrect CR Bit Index**: The Command Register (CR) description shows WR is bit 2 (0-indexed: bits 5:0 are STA, STO, RD, WR, ACK, IACK). The SVA uses `cr[2]` for WR, which is correct (bit 2 = WR). No issue here.\n     - **False Positives**: The WR bit is auto-cleared. If the user writes WR=1 and txr[0] changes in the same cycle, the assertion might miss it. However, since WR is set via WISHBONE, txr should be written before WR. The SVA uses `$rose(cr[2])`, which is correct if WR is set after txr is written.\n\n5. **TXR Stability During Transfer**:\n   - **Provided SVA**: Asserts txr remains stable while `sr[3]` (TIP) is high.\n   - **Flaws**:\n     - **Incomplete TIP Handling**: The spec states that during TIP, the user should not write to txr. However, the SVA only checks stability if TIP was high in the previous cycle. It doesn’t account for new WISHBONE writes during TIP, which could incorrectly change txr. The assertion should also check that if TIP is high, no WISHBONE write to txr occurs.\n     - **False Negatives**: The SVA uses `$stable(txr)`, which holds even if txr is written during TIP (since `$stable` checks against the previous value). However, the spec prohibits writes during TIP, so a separate assertion should check that no writes happen while TIP is active.\n\n**Additional Missing SVAs**:\n- **No Check for Writes During TIP**: The spec says users must not write to txr during an active transfer (TIP=1). An SVA should fire if a WISHBONE write occurs while TIP=1.\n- **No Check for txr Usage in DataIO Shift Register**: The spec mentions txr is loaded into the DataIO Shift Register, but without internal signals, this can’t be verified. However, the stability SVA indirectly covers this by ensuring txr doesn’t change during TIP.\n- **No Check for Slave Address Validity**: When issuing a START+WR (slave address phase), txr[7:1] should be a valid 7-bit address. The SVA only checks txr[0], not the full address.\n\n**Clock Cycle Misinterpretations**:\n- The connectivity SVA assumes txr updates in 1 cycle after a WISHBONE write, but the spec says WISHBONE accesses take 2 cycles. This could lead to false failures if the txr update is delayed by a cycle.\n\n**Nested Conditions**:\n- The connectivity SVA’s antecedent has multiple conditions (`wb_cyc_i`, `wb_stb_i`, etc.), but they’re straightforward. No nested if-else issues.\n\n**Completeness**:\n- Missing assertions for prohibited writes during TIP.\n- No check for txr[7:1] validity during address phases (if possible without internal signals).\n\n**Score**:\n- **Correctness**: 70/100 (missed reset handling in connectivity, TIP write prohibition).\n- **Consistency**: 80/100 (most SVAs align with spec, but some gaps).\n- **Completeness**: 60/100 (missing key checks).\n- **Total**: ~70/100.\n</think>\n\n**Feedback on SVAs for `txr`:**\n\n1. **Width Assertion**  \n   ✅ **Correct**. Properly verifies 8-bit width. No issues.\n\n2. **Connectivity SVA**  \n   ❌ **Flaws**:  \n   - **Reset Condition**: Uses `arst_i` directly instead of `arst_i == ARST_LVL`.  \n   - **Timing**: Assumes txr updates in 1 cycle, but WISHBONE accesses take 2 cycles.  \n   - **Missing Edge Cases**: Fails if `wb_rst_i` or `arst_i` is asserted during the write.  \n\n3. **Reset Value Check**  \n   ❌ **Flaw**:  \n   - Does not check if txr remains 0x00 *during* sustained reset (only checks the cycle after reset assertion).  \n\n4. **Valid R/W Bit SVA**  \n   ✅ **Correct**. Checks txr[0] validity when WR is issued.  \n\n5. **Stability During Transfer**  \n   ❌ **Flaws**:  \n   - Does not prevent WISHBONE writes to txr during TIP (violates spec).  \n   - Uses `$past(sr[3])`, which may miss transient TIP changes.  \n\n**Missing Critical SVAs**:  \n- **Prohibited Writes During TIP**:  \n  No check for WISHBONE writes to txr while `sr[3]` (TIP) is high.  \n- **Address Validity**:  \n  No check that txr[7:1] is non-zero during slave address transfers (if detectable without internal signals).  \n\n**Clock Cycle Issues**:  \n- The connectivity SVA assumes txr updates in 1 cycle, but WISHBONE uses 2-cycle accesses. This could cause false failures.  \n\n**Score**: **65/100**  \n- **Correctness**: Missed reset and timing nuances.  \n- **Consistency**: Fails to enforce no writes during TIP.  \n- **Completeness**: Lacks key protocol checks.  \n\n**Recommendations**:  \n1.

Its contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register for serial transmission on the SDA line, working in conjunction with the Command (CR) and Status (SR) registers.\n    [Additional information]: \n        - The reset value of the register is 0x00.\n        - Correct programming of TXR is essential for accurate I2C transactions, both for transmitting data and for setting the correct slave address transfer mode.\n[Related Signals]: DataIO Shift Register, CR, SR, RXR.\nPlease refine your old answer: <think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the txr signal based on the provided specification. Let\'s start by understanding what txr does.\n\nFirst, the txr is an 8-bit write-only register at address 0x03. Its bits 7:1 hold the next byte to transmit, and bit 0 is either the data\'s LSB or the R/W bit. The reset value is 0x00. It\'s connected to the WISHBONE interface and interacts with the DataIO Shift Register, CR, and SR.\n\nFor SVAs, I need to cover width, connectivity, and functionality checks.\n\nWidth assertion: Check that txr is always 8 bits wide. That\'s straightforward using $bits(txr) == 8.\n\nConnectivity: Since txr is write-only via WISHBONE, I should check that when the WISHBONE interface writes to address 0x03 with wb_we_i high, txr gets the data from wb_dat_i. Also, ensure that during a write operation (when WR bit in CR is set), the DataIO Shift Register loads txr\'s value. But the DataIO Shift Register isn\'t a signal here, so maybe focus on the WISHBONE interaction.\n\nFunctionality: When a write command (WR bit in CR) is issued, txr\'s value should be correctly used. For example, during a slave address transfer, bit 0 should be the R/W bit. But how to check that? Maybe when the core is in address phase (STA set, WR set), txr[0] should be 0 or 1. Also, after writing to txr and setting WR, the TIP in SR should be set until the transfer completes. However, the exact timing might depend on other signals.\n\nWait, the Command Register (CR) has WR and RD bits. When WR is set, the core should transmit the txr value. So an assertion could check that when WR is set, txr holds the correct data that\'s being sent. But how to track that? Maybe after a write to txr and WR is set, the DataIO Shift Register (not a signal here) would have that data. Since we can\'t reference internal registers, maybe check that when a write to CR with WR occurs, the txr has been written previously or simultaneously.\n\nAlso, since txr is write-only, any read from it via WISHBONE should not affect it, but the specification says it\'s write-only, so reads would be from another register. But the WISHBONE interface handles that, so maybe no SVA needed here.\n\nAnother point: After reset, txr should be 0x00. So an assertion that after reset, txr == 0.\n\nBut the reset could be asynchronous (arst_i) or synchronous (wb_rst_i). Need to check both conditions.\n\nConnectivity-wise, when the WISHBONE writes to address 0x03 (txr\'s address), with wb_we_i high, wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i high, then on the next clock edge, txr should take wb_dat_i. So an assertion that when a write transaction to txr occurs, txr updates accordingly.\n\nFunctionality: When a WR command is issued (CR\'s WR bit set), the txr\'s value should remain stable until the transfer starts. But how to track that? Maybe during the TIP (transfer in progress), txr shouldn\'t change, but the spec says that the user can write a new value once TIP is cleared. So when TIP is high, txr should not be written again. But that\'s more of a protocol check, perhaps covered by another assertion.\n\nAlso, during a slave address transfer, txr\'s bit 0 is the R/W bit. So if the core is sending an address (after a START), then txr[7:1] should be the slave address, and txr[0] the R/W direction. But how to detect that the core is in the address phase? It might require tracking the state machine, which isn\'t directly exposed. Maybe this is too internal and can\'t be checked without more info.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check txr is 8 bits.\n2. Connectivity: WISHBONE write to txr updates the register.\n3. Functionality: After reset, txr is 0. When WR is set, txr holds the data being sent (but how to verify it\'s transmitted? Maybe via the DataIO Shift Register, which isn\'t a signal here. Maybe this part is not feasible without internal signals.)\n4. Check that during a transfer (TIP high), txr isn\'t written again.\n5. When a slave address is sent (STA and WR set), txr[0] is the R/W bit (0 or 1), but since both are valid, maybe just check it\'s 0 or 1.\n\nBut the problem states not to create new signals, so I can\'t reference internal states like address phase. So maybe focus on what\'s observable.\n\nPossible SVAs:\n\n- Width: assert property ($bits(txr) == 8);\n- Connectivity: When WISHBONE writes to txr\'s address, txr gets the data.\n- Functionality: After reset, txr is 0. When WR is set in CR, txr remains stable until TIP goes low (but need to check if TIP is high during transfer).\n\nWait, the Status Register (SR) has TIP bit. So when TIP is high (transfer in progress), the txr should not be written again until TIP is low. But the user should not write during TIP, so an assertion could check that if TIP is high, txr doesn\'t change unless a WISHBONE write occurs, which it shouldn\'t. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, when a write to txr occurs while TIP is high, it might be invalid. But the spec says the user should wait until TIP is low. So an assertion could check that during TIP, no writes to txr happen.\n\nBut the WISHBONE interface allows writes anytime, but the core might ignore them during TIP. The spec says "The user may issue a new write or read command when the TIP flag is reset." So if the user writes to txr while TIP is high, it\'s possibly an error. But the core might latch the txr value only when the WR command is issued. So maybe the assertion is that when WR is set in CR, txr must have been written while TIP was low.\n\nAlternatively, when the WR bit is set (in CR), txr should have been written in the same cycle or prior. But since CR and txr are different registers, the user would write txr first, then CR. So maybe when WR is set, txr holds the value that was written before.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe focus on the connectivity and width, and basic functionality like reset value.\n\nSo the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. Connectivity: WISHBONE write to txr updates the register.\n3. Reset value check.\n4. When WR is set, txr is stable during the transfer.\n\nBut how to express that? Let\'s draft them.\n\nWidth:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (1\'b1) |-> ($bits(txr) == 8));\n\nConnectivity:\n\nWhen wb_adr_i is 0x03 (txr\'s address), wb_we_i is high, wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, then on the next clock, txr should be wb_dat_i.\n\nproperty TXR_Write;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_we_i && (wb_adr_i == 3\'h03)) |=> (txr == $past(wb_dat_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (TXR_Write);\n\nReset value:\n\nAfter reset (arst_i or wb_rst_i), txr should be 0.\n\nproperty TXR_Reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |=> (txr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (TXR_Reset);\n\nFunctionality: When WR is set in CR, txr remains stable until the transfer starts. But since the transfer starts when WR is set, maybe check that during the cycle when WR is set, txr doesn\'t change until TIP is set.\n\nAlternatively, when the WR command is issued (CR.WR is set), the txr value should not change until the transfer completes (TIP goes low). But how to track that? Because once WR is set, the core processes the command, and TIP goes high. So during TIP high, the user shouldn\'t write to txr again. But the assertion would check that if TIP is high, txr doesn\'t change unless there\'s a new write.\n\nBut the user could write to txr again while TIP is high, but the core might not use it until the next WR command. So maybe the assertion is that when TIP is high, any write to txr is held until TIP goes low. But without internal signals, it\'s hard to track.\n\nAlternatively, when the WR bit is set, the txr value at that time is captured, and during the transfer (TIP high), txr should remain the same. But how to check that? Because the user might write to txr again, but the core is using the previous value.\n\nThis might be too complex without internal signals. Maybe skip this part or find another angle.\n\nAnother functionality point: When a slave address is sent (STA and WR set), txr[0] is the R/W bit. But since the R/W bit can be 0 or 1, the assertion can check that txr[0] is either 0 or 1 when STA and WR are set. But how to trigger this? When CR.STA and CR.WR are set, check txr[0] is 0 or 1.\n\nBut CR.STA and CR.WR are in the Command Register. So when those bits are written, check txr\'s bit 0.\n\nBut the user writes to CR and txr in separate cycles. So when CR.STA and CR.WR are set, the txr should have been written beforehand. The assertion would need to check that at the time WR is set, txr[0] is valid.\n\nBut how to capture that? Maybe when the WR bit is set in CR, txr[0] is 0 or 1.\n\nproperty TXR_RW_Bit_Valid;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)\n  $rose(cr[2] /* WR bit */) |-> (txr[0] == 0 || txr[0] == 1);\nendproperty\nassert property (TXR_RW_Bit_Valid);\n\nBut the CR bits are write-only and cleared automatically. So when WR is set, it\'s only high for one cycle. So using $rose(cr[2]) would capture the rising edge when WR is written.\n\nThis checks that whenever the WR command is issued, the txr\'s bit 0 is a valid R/W value (0 or 1).\n\nAnother functionality: After writing to txr and issuing a WR command, the TIP bit should go high, indicating a transfer in progress. But this involves interaction between txr, CR, and SR, which might be covered in another SVA for CR or SR.\n\nIn conclusion, the main SVAs for txr are:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. Connectivity on WISHBONE write.\n3. Reset value.\n4.

The spec states txr is 8-bit. No issues here.\n\n2. **Connectivity (WISHBONE Write)**:\n   - **Provided SVA**: Asserts that a WISHBONE write to address 0x03 updates txr with `wb_dat_i` in the next cycle.\n   - **Flaws**:\n     - **Missing Reset Condition**: The `disable iff` clause includes `wb_rst_i` and `arst_i`, but the spec mentions `arst_i` is asynchronous and level-sensitive (ARST_LVL). The assertion should check `arst_i == ARST_LVL` instead of just `arst_i`.\n     - **Incomplete Address Check**: The spec uses 3-bit addressing (registers at 0x00-0x05). Address 0x03 is `3\'h03`, which is correct. No issue here.\n     - **Timing**: Uses `|=>`, which checks the next cycle. Correct, since WISHBONE writes take 2 cycles, but the core’s outputs are registered. However, the spec says "each access takes 2 clock cycles," so the txr update might take 2 cycles. The assertion assumes it updates in 1 cycle, which could be incorrect.\n\n3. **Reset Value Check**:\n   - **Provided SVA**: Checks txr == 0x00 after reset.\n   - **Flaws**:\n     - **Asynchronous Reset Handling**: Uses `arst_i == ARST_LVL`, which is correct. However, the `|=>` assumes the reset is de-asserted in the next cycle. If the reset is still active, txr should remain 0x00. The assertion only checks the cycle after reset assertion, not during sustained reset.\n\n4. **Valid R/W Bit When WR Command Issued**:\n   - **Provided SVA**: Checks that when `cr[2]` (WR bit) rises, `txr[0]` is 0 or 1.\n   - **Flaws**:\n     - **Incorrect CR Bit Index**: The Command Register (CR) description shows WR is bit 2 (0-indexed: bits 5:0 are STA, STO, RD, WR, ACK, IACK). The SVA uses `cr[2]` for WR, which is correct (bit 2 = WR). No issue here.\n     - **False Positives**: The WR bit is auto-cleared. If the user writes WR=1 and txr[0] changes in the same cycle, the assertion might miss it. However, since WR is set via WISHBONE, txr should be written before WR. The SVA uses `$rose(cr[2])`, which is correct if WR is set after txr is written.\n\n5. **TXR Stability During Transfer**:\n   - **Provided SVA**: Asserts txr remains stable while `sr[3]` (TIP) is high.\n   - **Flaws**:\n     - **Incomplete TIP Handling**: The spec states that during TIP, the user should not write to txr. However, the SVA only checks stability if TIP was high in the previous cycle. It doesn’t account for new WISHBONE writes during TIP, which could incorrectly change txr. The assertion should also check that if TIP is high, no WISHBONE write to txr occurs.\n     - **False Negatives**: The SVA uses `$stable(txr)`, which holds even if txr is written during TIP (since `$stable` checks against the previous value). However, the spec prohibits writes during TIP, so a separate assertion should check that no writes happen while TIP is active.\n\n**Additional Missing SVAs**:\n- **No Check for Writes During TIP**: The spec says users must not write to txr during an active transfer (TIP=1). An SVA should fire if a WISHBONE write occurs while TIP=1.\n- **No Check for txr Usage in DataIO Shift Register**: The spec mentions txr is loaded into the DataIO Shift Register, but without internal signals, this can’t be verified. However, the stability SVA indirectly covers this by ensuring txr doesn’t change during TIP.\n- **No Check for Slave Address Validity**: When issuing a START+WR (slave address phase), txr[7:1] should be a valid 7-bit address. The SVA only checks txr[0], not the full address.\n\n**Clock Cycle Misinterpretations**:\n- The connectivity SVA assumes txr updates in 1 cycle after a WISHBONE write, but the spec says WISHBONE accesses take 2 cycles. This could lead to false failures if the txr update is delayed by a cycle.\n\n**Nested Conditions**:\n- The connectivity SVA’s antecedent has multiple conditions (`wb_cyc_i`, `wb_stb_i`, etc.), but they’re straightforward. No nested if-else issues.\n\n**Completeness**:\n- Missing assertions for prohibited writes during TIP.\n- No check for txr[7:1] validity during address phases (if possible without internal signals).\n\n**Score**:\n- **Correctness**: 70/100 (missed reset handling in connectivity, TIP write prohibition).\n- **Consistency**: 80/100 (most SVAs align with spec, but some gaps).\n- **Completeness**: 60/100 (missing key checks).\n- **Total**: ~70/100.\n</think>\n\n**Feedback on SVAs for `txr`:**\n\n1. **Width Assertion**  \n   ✅ **Correct**. Properly verifies 8-bit width. No issues.\n\n2. **Connectivity SVA**  \n   ❌ **Flaws**:  \n   - **Reset Condition**: Uses `arst_i` directly instead of `arst_i == ARST_LVL`.  \n   - **Timing**: Assumes txr updates in 1 cycle, but WISHBONE accesses take 2 cycles.  \n   - **Missing Edge Cases**: Fails if `wb_rst_i` or `arst_i` is asserted during the write.  \n\n3. **Reset Value Check**  \n   ❌ **Flaw**:  \n   - Does not check if txr remains 0x00 *during* sustained reset (only checks the cycle after reset assertion).  \n\n4. **Valid R/W Bit SVA**  \n   ✅ **Correct**. Checks txr[0] validity when WR is issued.  \n\n5. **Stability During Transfer**  \n   ❌ **Flaws**:  \n   - Does not prevent WISHBONE writes to txr during TIP (violates spec).  \n   - Uses `$past(sr[3])`, which may miss transient TIP changes.  \n\n**Missing Critical SVAs**:  \n- **Prohibited Writes During TIP**:  \n  No check for WISHBONE writes to txr while `sr[3]` (TIP) is high.  \n- **Address Validity**:  \n  No check that txr[7:1] is non-zero during slave address transfers (if detectable without internal signals).  \n\n**Clock Cycle Issues**:  \n- The connectivity SVA assumes txr updates in 1 cycle, but WISHBONE uses 2-cycle accesses. This could cause false failures.  \n\n**Score**: **65/100**  \n- **Correctness**: Missed reset and timing nuances.  \n- **Consistency**: Fails to enforce no writes during TIP.  \n- **Completeness**: Lacks key protocol checks.  \n\n**Recommendations**:  \n1. Add SVA to block writes to txr during TIP:  \n   ```systemverilog\n   property TXR_NoWriteDuringTIP;\n     @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n     sr[3] |-> !(wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_we_i && (wb_adr_i == 3\'h03));\n   endproperty\n   assert property (TXR_NoWriteDuringTIP);\n   ```  \n2. Fix reset handling in connectivity SVA:  \n   Replace `disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)` with `disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)`.  \n3.

Once signal "sel_bit" is asserted, the target has to acknowledge by asserting the signal "trdy" after 2 clock cycles. After asserting signal "trdy" the target device waits for a valid data and a valid write signal if it is a write transaction. Once a valid write signal is detected, the incoming data is stored in the target device in locations starting fi-om the most updated value of the write pointer (wi) register. If it is a read transaction, then the target device reads out 8 data points from its memory using the current read pointer location (ri) as the starting address.\n\nThe type of transaction is indicated by the MSB of the bus "datain." In a read transaction, the data read appears on the bus vector "dataout."

LLM Output: <think>
Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `txr` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. The key points to consider are the width, connectivity, and functionality of `txr`, along with addressing the feedback from the previous answer.

First, I'll start by reviewing the specification for `txr`:

- **Width**: 8 bits, so a width assertion is straightforward.
- **Connectivity**: It's a write-only register at address 0x03, so I need to ensure that writes via the WISHBONE interface correctly update `txr`.
- **Functionality**: Includes reset value, valid R/W bit when issuing commands, stability during transfers, and preventing writes during active transfers (TIP).

From the feedback, the previous SVAs had issues with reset conditions, timing assumptions, and missing checks for writes during TIP. Let's address each point:

1. **Width Assertion**:
   - Simple check that `txr` is 8 bits. No syntax issues here.

2. **Connectivity Assertion**:
   - The previous SVA used `disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)`, but `arst_i` is level-sensitive (ARST_LVL). Correcting this to `arst_i == ARST_LVL`.
   - The spec mentions WISHBONE accesses take 2 cycles, but the assertion uses `|=>` (next cycle). However, since `txr` is a register, it's updated on the next clock edge after a valid write, which aligns with the SVA. No timing adjustment needed if the design latches `txr` immediately.

3. **Reset Value**:
   - The assertion checks `|=>` after reset, but should also check that `txr` remains 0x00 during reset. However, using `|=>` is correct if reset is synchronous. For asynchronous reset, it's better to use `arst_i == ARST_LVL` in the disable iff.

4. **Valid R/W Bit**:
   - The previous SVA correctly checks `txr[0]` when WR is set. No changes needed here.

5. **Stability During Transfer**:
   - The SVA checks stability when TIP is high but doesn't prevent writes during TIP. Adding a new assertion to block writes while TIP is active.

6. **Missing SVA for Writes During TIP**:
   - Adding a new property to ensure no WISHBONE writes to `txr` when TIP is high.

Now, structuring the SVAs into the required categories:

- **Width**: Simple assertion.
- **Connectivity**: WISHBONE write updates `txr`.
- **Functionality**: Reset value, R/W bit validity, stability during TIP, and no writes during TIP.

Final checks for syntax and correctness based on the spec and feedback. Ensure all disable conditions use `arst_i == ARST_LVL`, include the missing TIP write prohibition, and correct any timing issues.
