Okay, let's see. The user provided some SystemVerilog assertions with syntax errors and wants them fixed based on the documentation. The main issue seems to be that the signal names in the assertions don't match the actual Verilog code.

Looking at the error messages, the problem is that 'scl_padoen_oe' is not declared. The user mentioned that in the Verilog code, the signals were renamed: sda_padoen_o became sda_pad_oe and scl_padoen_o became scl_pad_oe. So the correct signal name should be scl_pad_oe instead of scl_padoen_oe.

The original assertion checks that when scl_pad_oe is 0 (output enabled), the scl_pad_i (input) should equal scl_pad_o (output). But in the documentation's external connections, scl_pad_i is an input, scl_pad_o is the output, and scl_padoen_o (now scl_pad_oe) is the output enable. 

So the corrected property should use scl_pad_oe. Also, the user specified not to use 'else' constructs, so the implication operator |-> is okay here. 

Wait, the original assertion was checking that when the output enable is active (low), the input matches the output. That makes sense because when the core is driving SCL, the input should reflect the output. 

So the corrected property should be:

property scl_connectivity;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (scl_pad_oe == 0) |-> (scl_pad_i == scl_pad_o);
endproperty

Then the assert statement. Also, the user might need to declare any parameters if missing, but the signals scl_pad_oe, scl_pad_i, and scl_pad_o are part of the module's ports as per the documentation. So no parameters are needed here.

So the corrected assertions would replace scl_padoen_oe with scl_pad_oe. That should fix the syntax error.

```systemverilog
property scl_connectivity;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (scl_pad_oe == 1'b0) |-> (scl_pad_i == scl_pad_o);
endproperty

assert property (scl_connectivity);
```
