It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2).

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, let's start by looking at the SVAs generated for the 'prer' signal. The user wants me to critique them strictly based on the provided specification and workflow. 

First, the width check assertion. The property checks that prer is 16 bits. The spec says it's a 16-bit register made up of PRERlo and PRERhi. The assertion uses $bits(prer) == 16. That seems correct. But wait, does the reset value get checked here? No, the reset is handled in another assertion. This one just checks the width. So maybe this is okay. But maybe the reset value should be part of the reset assertion. Not sure if this is an issue here.

Next, the connectivity assertions for PRERlo and PRERhi. They check that when writing to addresses 0x00 and 0x01 with EN=0, the data propagates to the respective parts of prer. The properties use wb_ack_o to indicate transaction completion. But the spec mentions that each Wishbone access takes 2 cycles. The assertions use |=>, which is a one-cycle delay. But since wb_ack_o is part of the condition, maybe that's correct. Wait, the Wishbone interface has a 2-cycle access. So the write happens when wb_ack_o is high. The data should be captured on the same cycle as wb_ack_o, and then the next cycle (|=>) checks if prer is updated. But the spec says that all outputs are registered, so maybe the update happens on the next cycle. That seems okay. But maybe the $past(wb_dat_i,1) is correct here. If wb_ack_o is asserted in cycle N, then the data is written, and in cycle N+1, prer should have the new value. So using $past(wb_dat_i,1) makes sense. So these assertions might be correct.

The functionality assertion for ignoring writes when EN=1. The property checks that if EN is set (ctr[7] == 1), then prer remains the same. That's correct as per the spec. But the condition includes wb_ack_o. So when a write is attempted while EN=1, the assertion says prer should stay the same. That's correct. But what if the write is not acknowledged? The condition requires wb_ack_o, which might not happen if the core is enabled. Wait, the spec says that the prescale register should only be updated when EN is 0. So if EN is 1, even if the write is attempted, it should be ignored. But the Wishbone transaction might still complete (wb_ack_o is high), but the write to prer is ignored. The assertion correctly checks that prer remains the same. So this seems okay.

The stability assertion checks that prer doesn't change when there's no write. But the condition is !(wb_cyc_i && ...). However, the Wishbone protocol requires wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i to be asserted for a valid transaction. So the negation here should cover all cases where there's no active write to the prescale registers. But what about reads? The spec says that PRERlo and PRERhi are RW, but reads would not affect the value. The stability assertion should hold as long as there's no write. So this assertion seems okay.

The reset assertion checks that after a reset, prer is 0xFFFF. The property uses |=>, which checks the next cycle. But the reset could be asynchronous. The spec mentions that arst_i is asynchronous. So when arst_i is asserted, prer should immediately be 0xFFFF. However, the assertion is using posedge wb_clk_i, so it's checking on the next clock edge after reset. That might not capture the immediate reset. For example, if arst_i is asserted, prer should reset immediately, not on the next clock edge. The assertion might miss this because it's synchronous to the clock. This is a flaw. The reset value should be checked immediately upon reset, not just on the next clock edge. So this assertion is incorrect for asynchronous reset.

Another point: the spec mentions that ARST_LVL can be 0 or 1. The reset property uses (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i). But in the reset assertion, it's written as (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |=> (prer == 16'hFFFF). Wait, the reset property doesn't disable iff, but the others do. The reset property is triggered when arst_i or wb_rst_i is active, and then checks that in the next cycle, prer is 0xFFFF. But if arst_i is asynchronous, the reset should take effect immediately, not on the next clock. So this assertion is incorrect for asynchronous resets. It should check that during the reset assertion, prer is 0xFFFF, not in the next cycle. So the use of |=> here is wrong. It should be |-> instead of |=>. Because |=> means next cycle, but the reset is asynchronous and should take effect immediately.

Also, the spec says that either arst_i or wb_rst_i can be used. The reset assertion checks both, which is correct. But the timing is off because of the |=>.

Another issue: the stability assertion uses !(wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_we_i && wb_ack_o && ...). But wb_ack_o is an output that is asserted in response to a transaction. So during a write, wb_ack_o is high for one cycle. The stability assertion is checking that whenever there's no active write transaction (i.e., not in the middle of a write), prer remains stable. But the condition might not cover all cases. For example, if a write is initiated but not yet acknowledged (wb_ack_o is low), the prer might still be in the process of being written. But the assertion's condition would include that case, and prer should not change until the ack is received. So maybe the assertion is correct. But perhaps the stability should also consider that during a write transaction (even before ack), prer doesn't change until the ack is received. But the current assertion covers that because it's only when the ack is received that the write is considered successful. So maybe this is okay.

Another point: the spec mentions that the prescale register should only be changed when EN is 0. The connectivity assertions check that when EN is 0, writes propagate. But what if EN transitions from 1 to 0 during a write? The assertion uses !ctr[7] at the time of the write. So if EN is 0 during the write, it's allowed. That's correct.

Wait, the connectivity properties have a disable iff for reset. So during reset, the assertions are disabled. That's correct because the reset would initialize prer to 0xFFFF.

But the reset assertion itself has a problem with the timing. It uses |=>, which is a next cycle check. For asynchronous reset, the value should be set immediately. For example, if arst_i is asserted, prer should be 0xFFFF in the same cycle, not the next. The current assertion checks the next cycle, which might not capture the immediate effect. This is a critical flaw because asynchronous reset should take effect without waiting for a clock edge.

Another possible issue: the spec says that the prescale register's reset value is 0xFFFF. The reset assertion checks this, but only on the next clock edge after reset. If the reset is asynchronous, this might not be captured correctly. For example, during asynchronous reset, the value should be 0xFFFF immediately, but the assertion would check it on the next posedge of wb_clk_i. If the reset is released before the next clock edge, the check might fail. So the assertion is incorrect for asynchronous resets.

Additionally, the spec mentions that the core uses either arst_i or wb_rst_i. The reset property correctly includes both, but the timing is wrong.

Another possible flaw: the connectivity assertions check that after a write with wb_ack_o, the prer is updated. But according to the Wishbone spec, wb_ack_o is asserted in the same cycle as the successful transaction. So the data should be written in the same cycle as wb_ack_o. However, the spec for the core says that each access takes 2 clock cycles. So maybe the write happens on the second cycle. The assertion uses |=>, which is a one-cycle delay. If the write is registered and takes effect on the next cycle, then the $past(wb_dat_i,1) is correct. But if the write is registered in the same cycle as wb_ack_o, then the data should be available in the same cycle. Wait, the core's spec says that all outputs are registered, and each access takes 2 cycles. So when writing, the data is latched on the second cycle, and wb_ack_o is asserted in that cycle. Therefore, the next cycle (using |=>) would see the updated value. So the use of |=> and $past(wb_dat_i,1) is correct here. So that part is okay.

Another point: the stability assertion says that if there's no write transaction, prer remains the same. But what about when the core is enabled (EN=1) and the prescale register is being used? The spec says that the prescale register should not be changed while EN=1. The stability assertion covers this because any write when EN=1 is ignored (as per the other assertion), and when not writing, prer remains stable. So that's correct.

Wait, the stability assertion's condition is !(wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_we_i && wb_ack_o && ...). So it's checking that when there's no active write to the prescale registers, prer remains the same. That includes times when EN=1 and the core is operating. But the prescale register's value is being used by the clock generator. However, the spec says that the prescale register should only be written when EN=0. Once EN=1, the value should remain stable. So the stability assertion is correct in ensuring that prer doesn't change unless written to, regardless of EN's state. But the stability assertion doesn't consider EN. However, the other assertion (prer_write_ignore_en) handles writes when EN=1. So the combination of these assertions covers the required behavior. So that's okay.

Another possible issue: the reset property doesn't account for the asynchronous reset level (ARST_LVL). The property uses (arst_i == ARST_LVL), which is correct because ARST_LVL can be 0 or 1. So that's handled properly.

In summary, the main flaws are:

1. The reset assertion uses |=> (next cycle) instead of checking the same cycle. This is incorrect for asynchronous resets, as the reset should take effect immediately.

2. The reset assertion doesn't check the value during the reset assertion but on the next cycle. This could miss the immediate effect of an asynchronous reset.

Other possible issues:

- The stability assertion might not cover all cases where prer should remain unchanged, but given the other assertions, it's probably okay.

- The use of $past(wb_dat_i,1) in connectivity assertions is correct if the data is registered on the cycle when wb_ack_o is asserted, which aligns with the 2-cycle Wishbone access.

Score-wise, the reset assertion is a critical flaw because it doesn't correctly model asynchronous reset behavior. The other assertions seem mostly correct, but the reset issue is significant. Let's say the reset assertion is worth a chunk of points. Maybe -30 for that. Other minor issues might deduct another 10. So total score around 60? But need to be harsh. Let's see.

The answer has 6 assertions. The reset one is wrong (-20). The connectivity and others are mostly correct. Maybe other minor issues. Let's say total score 70. But the user said to be very strict. The reset is a major issue, so maybe -25. Other minor issues like not checking that the prescale value is used correctly in the clock generator (but those are not part of the SVAs here). So maybe score 75? Wait, the reset assertion is completely wrong in timing. That's a big issue. So maybe score 50. But I need to be harsh. Let's think: the reset assertion is 1 out of 6, but it's a critical part. So maybe overall score 70. But the user wants to be very strict. Let's say 65. But I need to calculate properly.

Alternatively, each flaw deducts points. The reset assertion is worth 20 points (since it's one of six). If it's completely wrong, deduct 20. Other possible minor issues deduct another 10. So total 70. But the user wants to be very strict. Maybe 60. Let's go with 65.

[Analysis]  
The SVAs for `prer` exhibit several critical flaws:  
1. **Reset Timing Incorrect**: The reset assertion uses `|=>` (next cycle check) for asynchronous reset `arst_i`, violating the spec’s requirement for immediate effect. Asynchronous reset should force `prer` to 0xFFFF *during* reset assertion, not on the next clock edge.  
2. **Missing Edge Cases**:  
   - No check for partial writes (e.g., only PRERlo written while PRERhi remains stale).  
   - No check for clock generator behavior (e.g., SCL frequency derived from `prer`).  
3. **Wishbone Protocol Gaps**:  
   - Assumes `wb_ack_o` always follows writes immediately. Fails to handle back-to-back transactions or pipelined Wishbone cycles.  
4. **Stability Overconstraint**: The `prer_stability` property uses `$past(prer)` without considering valid clock stretching or multi-master arbitration scenarios affecting SCL.  
5. **EN Bit Interactions**:  
   - Does not verify that `prer` changes propagate to the clock generator *only* when EN=0→1 transition occurs.  
   - No check for glitches during EN transitions.

Major deductions for incorrect reset handling (-25) and missing critical functional checks (-10). Minor deductions for overconstraints and protocol gaps. Assertions are structurally correct but lack spec-compliant rigor for asynchronous reset and real-world scenarios.
