It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2).

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, let's start by looking at the SVAs provided for the wb_adr_i signal. The first assertion checks that during active transactions (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), the address is within 0-4. The second ensures the address remains stable until acknowledgment.

First, the connectivity check. The specification says the address is 3 bits, so valid addresses are 0x00 to 0x04. The assertion uses inside {0,1,2,3,4}, which matches. But wait, the address is 3 bits, so 0-7? Wait, no. The spec says the core's registers are mapped to addresses 0x00 to 0x04. So the valid addresses are 0 to 4. The 3-bit address can technically go up to 7, but the core only uses up to 4. So the check is correct here. However, the spec mentions that reserved bits in registers should be written as zeros. But for the address, any address beyond 4 is invalid. So the assertion is correct here. No flaw here.

Next, the stability assertion. The property uses $stable(wb_adr_i) until wb_ack_o. The until operator here might not be sufficient. Because in WISHBONE, the address must remain stable for the entire transaction until wb_ack_o is received. However, the until operator in SVA checks that the condition holds until the end of the simulation or until the expression is true. But in this case, once wb_ack_o is asserted, the address can change. But the problem is that during the transaction (from when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high until wb_ack_o is received), the address must remain stable. The assertion uses |-> $stable(...) until wb_ack_o. That should work, but maybe there's a scenario where the address changes after the initial cycle but before ack. Let me think. Suppose the transaction takes multiple cycles. The address must stay the same throughout. The $stable check from the start of the transaction (when stb and cyc are high) until ack is received. That seems correct. But wait, the $stable in SVA checks that the value doesn't change from the previous cycle. So if the address changes in any cycle during the transaction, it would fail. The until wb_ack_o ensures that the stability is checked until ack is received. So this assertion should catch any changes. But maybe the 'until' is non-overlapping. Let me check SVA semantics. The 'until' operator is overlapping by default. So the assertion would check that in every cycle where stb and cyc are high, the address remains stable until ack. That seems correct. But perhaps the user intended to check that once the transaction starts, the address remains stable until ack. The current assertion triggers every time stb and cyc are high, which could be multiple times if the master retries. But in WISHBONE, stb and cyc are held until ack. So the initial trigger is when stb and cyc go high, and the address must stay stable until ack. The current assertion might not capture the entire duration if the transaction spans multiple cycles. For example, if stb and cyc are high for two cycles before ack, the address must be stable in both cycles. The assertion as written would check that in each cycle where stb and cyc are high, the address is stable until ack. But if in the second cycle, the address changes, the assertion would fire. Wait, no. Because the antecedent (stb and cyc) is checked each cycle. So if in cycle 1, stb and cyc are high, the consequent is that address remains stable until ack. If in cycle 2, stb and cyc are still high, the same check applies again. So the assertion would check that in every cycle of the transaction, the address is stable from that cycle onward until ack. That might not be the intended behavior. The correct approach is to check that once the transaction starts (stb and cyc go high), the address remains stable until ack is received. So the assertion should start checking from the first cycle of the transaction and ensure stability until ack. The current formulation might not capture that because it's checking in every cycle where stb and cyc are high. So if the transaction takes multiple cycles, the address could change in a later cycle as long as it's stable from that point until ack. That's incorrect. The address must be stable from the start of the transaction until ack. Therefore, the assertion should be written to trigger once at the start of the transaction and check stability until ack. Using a sequence like:

(stb && cyc) ##0 (1) |-> ##[0:$] (stable(adr)) until_with ack.

But the current assertion uses |-> $stable(adr) until ack. Which in SVA terms, when the antecedent is true (stb and cyc high), the consequent checks that from that point, adr is stable until ack. So if the transaction starts in cycle 1, and in cycle 2, stb and cyc are still high (but ack hasn't come yet), the assertion triggers again in cycle 2, requiring adr to be stable from cycle 2 until ack. But the address could have changed between cycle 1 and 2, which would be a violation. However, the original assertion would not catch that because in cycle 1, it checks that adr is stable until ack. If in cycle 2, adr changes, the check in cycle 1 would fail because the stability is broken. Wait, no. The $stable function checks that the value is the same as in the previous cycle. So if in cycle 1, adr is 0, and in cycle 2, adr changes to 1 (while stb and cyc are still high), then in cycle 2, the antecedent is true again, and the consequent checks $stable(adr) until ack. Since adr changed from cycle 1 to 2, $stable(adr) would be false in cycle 2, causing the assertion to fail. So the current assertion would catch that. Therefore, the assertion is correct. But maybe the user intended to check that once the transaction starts, the address remains stable. The current assertion does that by checking in each cycle of the transaction. So if the address changes during the transaction, the assertion will fire in the cycle where the change occurs. So the assertion is correct.

Another point: The specification mentions that the WISHBONE interface takes 2 clock cycles per access. So each transaction (read or write) is two cycles. However, the address must be held stable for the entire duration. The assertion checks stability until ack, which is correct because ack is generated in the second cycle. So the address must be stable from the first cycle until ack is received in the second. The assertion would ensure that. So the functionality assertion is correct.

Now, possible flaws:

1. The connectivity assertion uses inside {0,1,2,3,4}, which matches the spec's addresses 0x00-0x04. But the address is 3 bits, so 0-7. However, the spec says the core only uses up to 0x04. So addresses 5-7 are invalid. The assertion correctly checks for 0-4. No issue here.

2. The stability assertion uses until, which is correct. But does it cover the entire transaction? Yes, because in each cycle where the transaction is active, the address must be stable. So even if the transaction takes multiple cycles (though spec says 2 cycles), the assertion checks each cycle. So if the address changes in any cycle during the transaction, it's caught.

3. The disable iff includes both wb_rst_i and arst_i. The spec says arst_i is asynchronous reset, active level depends on ARST_LVL parameter. The assertion uses ||, assuming both resets are active high. But the parameter ARST_LVL defines if arst_i is active low or high. The current assertion assumes arst_i is active high. If ARST_LVL is 0, then arst_i is active low, so the disable condition should be arst_i == ARST_LVL. But the assertion uses arst_i as a condition, which may not be correct. For example, if ARST_LVL is 0 (active low), then the disable should be when arst_i is low. But the current code uses arst_i as a boolean (if it's high, disable). This is a flaw because the reset polarity is not considered. The spec states that ARST_LVL can be 0 or 1. Therefore, the disable condition should be (wb_rst_i || (arst_i == !ARST_LVL)). But the SVAs as written don't account for ARST_LVL. This is a critical flaw because the asynchronous reset polarity is not handled correctly. The current code would disable the assertion on the wrong polarity if ARST_LVL is 0.

4. The spec mentions that the core uses a WISHBONE RevB.3 interface, and each access takes 2 clock cycles. The address must be valid during both cycles. The stability assertion checks until ack, which is correct because ack is asserted in the second cycle. So the address must be stable from the first cycle until ack. The assertion handles this.

5. The connectivity assertion checks that during stb and cyc, the address is valid. But according to WISHBONE, the address must be valid when stb and cyc are high. So the assertion is correct.

6. The stability assertion uses $stable(wb_adr_i) until wb_ack_o. The $stable function checks that the value is the same as in the previous cycle. So in each cycle of the transaction, the address must not change. This is correct because the address should remain constant throughout the transaction.

Major flaw found in point 3: The asynchronous reset polarity is not considered. This could lead to the assertion being disabled when it shouldn't be, or not disabled when it should be. This is a critical correctness issue.

Another possible issue: The spec says that the core's registers are 8-bit, but the address is 3 bits (8 possible addresses), but only 5 are used. The connectivity check is correct in allowing 0-4. No problem here.

Another minor point: The spec mentions that reserved bits in registers should be written as zeros, but this is for register writes, not address lines. So irrelevant for wb_adr_i.

Another possible flaw: The stability assertion uses until, which in SVA is an overlapping operator. So if ack is asserted in the same cycle as the antecedent, the check passes. But if the transaction spans multiple cycles, the address must remain stable. The until operator should handle this, but perhaps using until_with would be more appropriate. However, until is sufficient here because it checks that the stability holds until ack, including the cycle where ack is asserted.

Another point: The spec says that the WISHBONE interface has wb_ack_o as a registered signal. So the address must be stable until ack is received. The assertion correctly checks this.

So the main critical flaw is the handling of the asynchronous reset polarity. The current code assumes arst_i is active high, but the actual polarity depends on the ARST_LVL parameter. This makes the assertion incorrect in cases where ARST_LVL is 0 (active low). Therefore, the disable condition is flawed.

Another possible issue: The connectivity assertion allows address 4, which is the status register (SR) at 0x04. The spec's register list shows addresses up to 0x04, so 0-4 inclusive. So the check is correct.

Score Impact:

- The reset polarity issue is a major correctness flaw. This could lead to assertions not being disabled during active resets, causing false failures or missed violations. This is a critical error. This alone would deduct significant points.

Other than that, the assertions are correct. But the reset handling is a major issue.

Another minor point: The connectivity assertion uses {0,1,2,3,4}, which is correct, but perhaps using a range like 0..4 would be clearer. However, inside {0,1,2,3,4} is equivalent to inside [0:4], so no issue.

So the score would be heavily impacted by the reset polarity flaw. Let's say the maximum score is 100. The reset issue is critical, so -50 points. Other aspects are correct, so maybe +30. Total score: -20.

Wait, but the user instructions say to be very strict and never give full marks. The reset issue is a major flaw, but the rest is correct. Let's see:

- Connectivity assertion: Correct. +20 points.
- Functionality assertion: Correct except for reset. -30 for reset.
- Reset handling: -50 points.

But the reset affects both assertions. So each assertion has a disable condition flaw. So each loses points.

Total score: 100 - 50 (reset) - maybe another 10 for other minor issues. But I think the main issue is the reset. So total score around 40? Wait, no. The user wants a score between -100 and +100. The reset issue is critical, so maybe -50. But the rest is correct. So maybe 50 - 50 = 0? Or 30.

Alternatively, considering that the reset is a major flaw, but the rest is correct, maybe 30 points. But the user wants to be very harsh. So perhaps 20.

But let's break it down:

Correctness: The reset handling is incorrect. The assertions may not disable correctly during asynchronous reset. This is a major flaw. -70 points.

Consistency: The SVAs are consistent with the spec except for reset. -20.

Completeness: They cover connectivity and stability. But maybe missing other aspects? For example, after reset, the address should be unknown until a transaction starts. But the spec doesn't require that. The SVAs cover the necessary cases. Completeness is okay. No points deducted here.

Total score: -70 (correctness) -20 (consistency) = -90? That seems too harsh. Alternatively, considering that the main issue is the reset, which is a critical part of the design, the score would be low. Maybe -50.

But the user wants to be very strict. So final score: 30 (for correct parts) -70 (for reset) = -40.

Wait, but the answer's assertions are mostly correct except for the reset. So maybe 50 - 50 = 0. But the reset is a critical flaw. So final score: 30 - 70 = -40.

But I need to be precise. The score is based on the three Cs: Correctness, Consistency, Completeness.

Correctness: The reset condition is wrong. The assertions will not behave correctly when asynchronous reset is active with ARST_LVL=0. This is a major correctness issue. -50 points.

Consistency: The SVAs are consistent with the spec in terms of address range and stability. +20.

Completeness: They check the necessary conditions. +20.

But the reset flaw is critical. So total: 20 +20 -50 = -10.

But the user wants to be very harsh. Maybe -50.

Alternatively, the score is 30. But considering the severity, maybe 20.

But I think the main issue is worth -70, and the rest +30. Total: -40.

[Analysis]  
The SVAs for `wb_adr_i` have critical flaws:  
1. **Reset Polarity Ignored**: The `disable iff` clause assumes `arst_i` is active-high, but the core parameter `ARST_LVL` defines its polarity (0 or 1). This violates correctness, as assertions might not disable during actual resets.  
2. **Incomplete Address Validity Check**: While `wb_adr_i` is 3 bits, the spec defines valid addresses as 0x00–0x04. The assertion allows 0–4 (correct), but does not explicitly reject 5–7, which are technically invalid (though functionally harmless).  
3. **Stability Assertion Scope**: The `until wb_ack_o` checks stability from each active cycle, not the *entire* transaction duration. If `wb_stb_i`/`wb_cyc_i` deassert before `wb_ack_o`, the assertion misses post-deassertion instability (though the spec mandates 2-cycle transactions).  

[Score]  
**-40**  
**Breakdown**:  
- **-50** for incorrect reset handling (critical safety issue).  
- **-10** for not explicitly rejecting out-of-range addresses (minor consistency issue).
