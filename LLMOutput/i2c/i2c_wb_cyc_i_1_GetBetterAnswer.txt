It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

The Byte Command Controller tells the Bit Command Controller\nwhich operation has to be performed. For a single byte read, the Bit Command Controller\nreceives 8 separate read commands. Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<think>\nOkay, let\'s tackle generating SVAs for the wb_cyc_i signal based on the provided specifications. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the three main types of assertions required: width, connectivity, and functionality. \n\nStarting with the width assertion. The description says wb_cyc_i is a 1-bit signal. So the width check is straightforward. The SVA should verify that the signal is indeed 1 bit wide using $bits.\n\nNext, connectivity. The signal is part of the WISHBONE interface and works with wb_stb_i. The spec mentions that wb_cyc_i indicates a valid bus cycle and that the core processes transactions only when both wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are active. So, connectivity checks should ensure that when wb_cyc_i is active (high), other related signals like wb_stb_i, wb_adr_i, etc., are properly engaged. Also, when wb_cyc_i is low, the core shouldn\'t be processing transactions, so maybe check that wb_ack_o isn\'t asserted when wb_cyc_i is low.\n\nFor functionality, the key points are:\n1. wb_cyc_i must remain high throughout a bus transaction. The WISHBONE standard typically requires that once a cycle starts (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high), they stay high until the transaction completes with wb_ack_o. So an assertion could check that once wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, they remain high until wb_ack_o is received.\n2. When a reset (wb_rst_i) is active, wb_cyc_i should be low because the core shouldn\'t be processing transactions during reset.\n3. After a transaction (when wb_ack_o is high), wb_cyc_i might be deasserted, but according to WISHBONE, the master can keep it high for pipelined transactions. However, if it\'s deasserted, then wb_stb_i should also be low.\n\nAlso, considering the Wishbone specification, wb_cyc_i must be asserted for the entire duration of the bus cycle. So any transaction (indicated by wb_stb_i) must occur only when wb_cyc_i is high. So an assertion that whenever wb_stb_i is high, wb_cyc_i must also be high.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE interface in the core takes two clock cycles per access. So maybe check that after a transaction starts (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i high), wb_ack_o comes two cycles later. But that might be more related to the overall interface timing rather than just wb_cyc_i.\n\nWait, but the user specified not to create new signals, so I should stick to the given signals. Also, the core\'s WISHBONE is classic, with each access taking two cycles. So when wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are asserted, wb_ack_o should be asserted in the next cycle, but maybe that\'s part of the connectivity check.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWidth: Check that wb_cyc_i is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity:\n- When wb_cyc_i is high, wb_stb_i must also be high for a valid transaction. Or maybe that whenever wb_stb_i is high, wb_cyc_i must be high, as per Wishbone rules.\n- When wb_cyc_i is low, wb_ack_o should not be asserted.\n- Also, during a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i high), the address and data signals should be stable until ack is received.\n\nFunctionality:\n- wb_cyc_i remains high until the transaction completes (acknowledged by wb_ack_o).\n- After reset, wb_cyc_i should be low until a new transaction starts.\n- Check that wb_cyc_i doesn\'t change during a transaction (i.e., between wb_stb_i high and wb_ack_o high).\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_cyc_i) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: If wb_stb_i is high, then wb_cyc_i must be high. Because Wishbone requires that STB can\'t be active without CYC.\n\n3. Connectivity: When wb_cyc_i is low, wb_ack_o should be low.\n\n4. Functionality: Once wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, they remain high until wb_ack_o is high.\n\n5. Functionality: After reset, wb_cyc_i is low until a transaction starts.\n\n6. During a transaction (wb_cyc_i high and wb_stb_i high), the address (wb_adr_i) and data inputs (wb_dat_i, wb_we_i) remain stable until ack.\n\nBut need to ensure that these are based on the given specs. The spec says that all accesses take two clock cycles. So maybe check that once wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, wb_ack_o goes high after two cycles.\n\nWait, the spec says: "Each access takes 2 clock cycles." So when a valid transaction starts (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i high), then wb_ack_o should be asserted two cycles later. That\'s a functional assertion.\n\nBut how does that relate to wb_cyc_i? The wb_cyc_i must stay high during those two cycles.\n\nSo possible assertions:\n\n- When wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, wb_ack_o should go high two cycles later, and during those two cycles, wb_cyc_i remains high.\n\nBut the user mentioned not to create new signals, so maybe focus on the stability of wb_cyc_i during the transaction.\n\nAnother point from the spec: The core\'s WISHBONE interface is classic, meaning that each transfer is a single read or write, and the cycle (wb_cyc_i) is asserted for the duration of the transfer. So once a transfer starts (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i high), wb_cyc_i should stay high until the transfer completes (wb_ack_o high).\n\nSo an assertion could be: Once wb_cyc_i is high and wb_stb_i is high, wb_cyc_i remains high until wb_ack_o is high.\n\nAlso, after wb_ack_o is high, wb_cyc_i can either stay high (for another transaction) or go low. But during the transaction, it must stay high.\n\nAnother thing: The WISHBONE standard says that wb_cyc_i must be asserted for the entire duration of the bus cycle. So any time wb_stb_i is asserted, wb_cyc_i must also be asserted. So an assertion that whenever wb_stb_i is high, wb_cyc_i is also high.\n\nPutting this all together, the SVAs would be:\n\nWidth: Check 1-bit.\n\nConnectivity:\n- If wb_stb_i is high, then wb_cyc_i must be high.\n- When wb_cyc_i is low, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nFunctionality:\n- Once wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, they stay high until wb_ack_o is high.\n- After reset, wb_cyc_i is low until a transaction starts.\n- During a transaction (wb_cyc_i high and wb_stb_i high), the address and data inputs are stable until ack.\n\nBut the last point about address and data stability might involve other signals like wb_adr_i and wb_dat_i, which are part of the related signals. Since the user allows using related signals, that\'s acceptable.\n\nSo, the assertions would look like:\n\n// Width assertion\nassert property ($bits(wb_cyc_i) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: wb_stb_i implies wb_cyc_i\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_stb_i |-> wb_cyc_i);\n\n// Connectivity: When cyc is low, ack is low\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) !wb_cyc_i |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\n// Functionality: cyc and stb stay high until ack\nproperty cyc_stb_until_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) throughout (##[1:2] wb_ack_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (cyc_stb_until_ack);\n\n// Functionality: After reset, cyc is low\n// This might be tricky because after reset, the signal could be anything until a transaction starts. But the core\'s WISHBONE is a slave, so it\'s the master that asserts cyc. So maybe not applicable here. Alternatively, check that during reset, cyc is low. But the reset here is synchronous (wb_rst_i). So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_rst_i |-> !wb_cyc_i);\n\nWait, but wb_cyc_i is an input to the core, so the core doesn\'t control it. The core\'s master (the system controlling it) asserts wb_cyc_i. So the core can\'t enforce that after reset wb_cyc_i is low. That\'s up to the master. Therefore, that assertion might not be valid because the core can\'t control the input. So maybe skip that.\n\nInstead, check that during a reset, if wb_cyc_i is asserted, then the core ignores it. But that\'s more complex. Alternatively, since the core is a slave, when reset is active, it should not respond, so maybe wb_ack_o should remain low during reset regardless of wb_cyc_i. But that\'s more about wb_ack_o behavior.\n\nHmm, perhaps the functionality assertion should focus on the core\'s response. For example, during reset, the core does not acknowledge any transaction, so even if wb_cyc_i is high, wb_ack_o remains low. But that\'s more about wb_ack_o than wb_cyc_i.\n\nGiven that, maybe the functionality assertions for wb_cyc_i are:\n\n- Once a transaction starts (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i high), it remains high until ack is received.\n- Transactions take two cycles, so after wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, ack comes in two cycles.\n\nBut how to model that? For example:\n\n// Check that ack occurs exactly two cycles after cyc and stb are asserted\nproperty ack_in_two_cycles;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> ##2 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_in_two_cycles);\n\nBut the spec says each access takes two clock cycles. So this assertion would check that. However, this depends on the core\'s design. If the core\'s WISHBONE interface indeed takes two cycles, then this is valid. But since the user provided that information, it\'s correct to include it.\n\nAdditionally, during those two cycles, wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i must remain high. So combining both:\n\nOnce cyc and stb are high, they stay high for two cycles until ack is asserted.\n\nSo:\n\nproperty cyc_stb_stable;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> ##1 (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (cyc_stb_stable);\n\nThis ensures that after cyc and stb are high, they stay high for the next cycle, and in the second cycle, ack is high.\n\nAnother point: When ack is high, cyc can stay high or go low. But during the two cycles, cyc must stay high.\n\nAlso, during the transaction, the address and data inputs (wb_adr_i, wb_dat_i, wb_we_i) should remain stable. So:\n\n// During a transaction, address and data are stable\nproperty addr_data_stable;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> ##1 (wb_adr_i == $past(wb_adr_i) && wb_dat_i == $past(wb_dat_i) && wb_we_i == $past(wb_we_i)) ##0 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (addr_data_stable);\n\nBut this might be more related to the WISHBONE protocol rather than the core\'s specific behavior. However, the spec mentions that all outputs are registered and each access takes two cycles. So the inputs (address, data, we) should be stable during those two cycles.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would include:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. Connectivity: stb implies cyc.\n3. Connectivity: cyc low implies ack low.\n4. Functionality: cyc and stb remain high until ack in two cycles.\n5. Functionality: address/data stability during transaction.\n\nBut need to ensure that all assertions are correct and don\'t introduce new signals.\n\nFinal list of assertions for wb_cyc_i:\n\n- Width: 1 bit.\n- Connectivity: If wb_stb_i is high, wb_cyc_i must be high.\n- Connectivity: When wb_cyc_i is low, wb_ack_o is low.\n- Functionality: Once wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, they remain high until wb_ack_o is asserted two cycles later.\n- Functionality: During the transaction (from cyc and stb high to ack high), address and data inputs are stable.\n\nNow, translating these into SVA:\n\nFor the two-cycle access:\n\nproperty two_cycle_access;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |=> (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (two_cycle_access);\n\nThis uses |=> to check that in the next cycle, cyc and stb are still high, then in the following cycle, ack is high.\n\nFor address/data stability:\n\nproperty input_stability;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |=> (wb_adr_i == $past(wb_adr_i,1) && wb_dat_i == $past(wb_dat_i,1) && wb_we_i == $past(wb_we_i,1));\nendproperty\nassert property (input_stability);\n\nThis checks that in the cycle after cyc and stb are high, the address, data, and we signals remain the same as they were in the previous cycle.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be as follows.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: Verify `wb_cyc_i` is 1-bit wide.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - `wb_stb_i` (strobe) must only be active when `wb_cyc_i` is high (WISHBONE rule).\n   - `wb_ack_o` (acknowledge) must be low when `wb_cyc_i` is inactive.\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_cyc_i` remains high until the transaction completes (2 cycles with `wb_ack_o`).\n   - Address/data inputs (`wb_adr_i`, `wb_dat_i`, `wb_we_i`) remain stable during the transaction.\n   - Transaction completes in exactly 2 cycles after `wb_cyc_i` and `wb_stb_i` are asserted.\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check using `$bits`.\n- **Connectivity**: Implication checks between `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_stb_i`, and `wb_ack_o`.\n- **Functionality**: Stability and timing checks using sequences and `$past`.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion: wb_cyc_i must be 1-bit wide\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) ($bits(wb_cyc_i) == 1));\n\n// Connectivity: wb_stb_i can only be active when wb_cyc_i is high\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_stb_i |-> wb_cyc_i);\n\n// Connectivity: No acknowledge when cycle is inactive\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) !wb_cyc_i |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\n// Functionality: wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i remain high until ack in 2 cycles\nproperty cyc_stb_until_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |=> (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (cyc_stb_until_ack);\n\n// Functionality: Address/data stability during transaction\nproperty input_stability;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |=> (wb_adr_i == $past(wb_adr_i) && wb_dat_i == $past(wb_dat_i) && wb_we_i == $past(wb_we_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (input_stability);\n```'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "<think>\n\nOkay, let's analyze the provided SVAs for `wb_cyc_i` step by step, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, and potential flaws. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **1. Width Assertion**\n```systemverilog\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) ($bits(wb_cyc_i) == 1));\n```\n- **Correctness**: Valid. Checks the signal is 1-bit wide as per spec.\n- **Flaw**: Missing `disable iff (wb_rst_i)`. If the system is in reset, this assertion might fire unnecessarily during initialization.\n- **Score Impact**: Minor deduction (-5). Not critical but could cause false negatives during reset.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Connectivity: `wb_stb_i` Implies `wb_cyc_i`**\n```systemverilog\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_stb_i |-> wb_cyc_i);\n```\n- **Correctness**: Correct. WISHBONE requires `wb_stb_i` to be valid only when `wb_cyc_i` is high.\n- **Flaw**: Missing `disable iff (wb_rst_i)`. During reset, `wb_stb_i` could be glitchy, leading to false failures.\n- **Score Impact**: Moderate deduction (-10). Reset handling is critical for robustness.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Connectivity: `wb_cyc_i` Low → `wb_ack_o` Low**\n```systemverilog\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) !wb_cyc_i |-> !wb_ack_o);\n```\n- **Correctness**: Correct. The core should not acknowledge transactions when `wb_cyc_i` is inactive.\n- **Flaw**: Missing `disable iff (wb_rst_i)`. During reset, `wb_ack_o` might not be driven, causing false failures.\n- **Score Impact**: Moderate deduction (-10). Reset exclusion needed.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Functionality: `wb_cyc_i` Stability Until `wb_ack_o`**\n```systemverilog\nproperty cyc_stb_until_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |=> (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (cyc_stb_until_ack);\n```\n- **Correctness**: Partially correct. Ensures `wb_cyc_i` and `wb_stb_i` stay high for 2 cycles until `wb_ack_o`.\n- **Flaws**:\n  - **Overconstraining**: WISHBONE allows `wb_stb_i` to deassert earlier if the master supports pipelining. The assertion forces `wb_stb_i` to stay high for both cycles, which is not strictly required by the standard.\n  - **Timing**: The spec states transactions take 2 cycles, but the assertion uses `##1` (1 cycle delay), which would check for `wb_ack_o` in the *second* cycle. However, `|=>` checks the next cycle, so `##1` after `|=>` totals 2 cycles. This is correct but could be clarified.\n- **Score Impact**: Major deduction (-20). Overconstraining `wb_stb_i` violates WISHBONE flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Functionality: Address/Data Stability**\n```systemverilog\nproperty input_stability;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |=> (wb_adr_i == $past(wb_adr_i) && wb_dat_i == $past(wb_dat_i) && wb_we_i == $past(wb_we_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (input_stability);\n```\n- **Correctness**: Correct for the core’s 2-cycle access.

Split long conditions into separate assertions for clarity."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate SVAs for wb_cyc_i. \n[Signal name]: wb_cyc_i\n[Description]:\n    [Definition]: 1-bit wide input signal that indicates the validity of a bus cycle on the WISHBONE interface.\n    [Functionality]: Signals that a valid bus cycle is in progress, ensuring the core processes transactions only when an active bus cycle is present. Works with wb_stb_i to validate the current transaction.\n    [Interconnection]: Part of the WISHBONE interface; it interfaces with signals such as wb_stb_i, wb_adr_i, wb_dat_i, wb_dat_o, wb_we_i, and wb_ack_o to coordinate data transfers.\n    [Additional information]: Essential for proper transaction timing, wb_cyc_i ensures that the I2C core only responds during valid bus cycles, contributing to reliable system communication.\n[Related Signals]: wb_stb_i, wb_adr_i, wb_dat_i, wb_dat_o, wb_we_i, wb_ack_o, wb_clk_i, wb_rst_i.\nPlease refine your old answer: <think>\nOkay, let\'s tackle generating SVAs for the wb_cyc_i signal based on the provided specifications. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the three main types of assertions required: width, connectivity, and functionality. \n\nStarting with the width assertion. The description says wb_cyc_i is a 1-bit signal. So the width check is straightforward. The SVA should verify that the signal is indeed 1 bit wide using $bits.\n\nNext, connectivity. The signal is part of the WISHBONE interface and works with wb_stb_i. The spec mentions that wb_cyc_i indicates a valid bus cycle and that the core processes transactions only when both wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are active. So, connectivity checks should ensure that when wb_cyc_i is active (high), other related signals like wb_stb_i, wb_adr_i, etc., are properly engaged. Also, when wb_cyc_i is low, the core shouldn\'t be processing transactions, so maybe check that wb_ack_o isn\'t asserted when wb_cyc_i is low.\n\nFor functionality, the key points are:\n1. wb_cyc_i must remain high throughout a bus transaction. The WISHBONE standard typically requires that once a cycle starts (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high), they stay high until the transaction completes with wb_ack_o. So an assertion could check that once wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, they remain high until wb_ack_o is received.\n2. When a reset (wb_rst_i) is active, wb_cyc_i should be low because the core shouldn\'t be processing transactions during reset.\n3. After a transaction (when wb_ack_o is high), wb_cyc_i might be deasserted, but according to WISHBONE, the master can keep it high for pipelined transactions. However, if it\'s deasserted, then wb_stb_i should also be low.\n\nAlso, considering the Wishbone specification, wb_cyc_i must be asserted for the entire duration of the bus cycle. So any transaction (indicated by wb_stb_i) must occur only when wb_cyc_i is high. So an assertion that whenever wb_stb_i is high, wb_cyc_i must also be high.\n\nAnother point: The WISHBONE interface in the core takes two clock cycles per access. So maybe check that after a transaction starts (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i high), wb_ack_o comes two cycles later. But that might be more related to the overall interface timing rather than just wb_cyc_i.\n\nWait, but the user specified not to create new signals, so I should stick to the given signals. Also, the core\'s WISHBONE is classic, with each access taking two cycles. So when wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are asserted, wb_ack_o should be asserted in the next cycle, but maybe that\'s part of the connectivity check.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWidth: Check that wb_cyc_i is 1 bit.\n\nConnectivity:\n- When wb_cyc_i is high, wb_stb_i must also be high for a valid transaction. Or maybe that whenever wb_stb_i is high, wb_cyc_i must be high, as per Wishbone rules.\n- When wb_cyc_i is low, wb_ack_o should not be asserted.\n- Also, during a valid cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i high), the address and data signals should be stable until ack is received.\n\nFunctionality:\n- wb_cyc_i remains high until the transaction completes (acknowledged by wb_ack_o).\n- After reset, wb_cyc_i should be low until a new transaction starts.\n- Check that wb_cyc_i doesn\'t change during a transaction (i.e., between wb_stb_i high and wb_ack_o high).\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_cyc_i) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: If wb_stb_i is high, then wb_cyc_i must be high. Because Wishbone requires that STB can\'t be active without CYC.\n\n3. Connectivity: When wb_cyc_i is low, wb_ack_o should be low.\n\n4. Functionality: Once wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, they remain high until wb_ack_o is high.\n\n5. Functionality: After reset, wb_cyc_i is low until a transaction starts.\n\n6. During a transaction (wb_cyc_i high and wb_stb_i high), the address (wb_adr_i) and data inputs (wb_dat_i, wb_we_i) remain stable until ack.\n\nBut need to ensure that these are based on the given specs. The spec says that all accesses take two clock cycles. So maybe check that once wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, wb_ack_o goes high after two cycles.\n\nWait, the spec says: "Each access takes 2 clock cycles." So when a valid transaction starts (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i high), then wb_ack_o should be asserted two cycles later. That\'s a functional assertion.\n\nBut how does that relate to wb_cyc_i? The wb_cyc_i must stay high during those two cycles.\n\nSo possible assertions:\n\n- When wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, wb_ack_o should go high two cycles later, and during those two cycles, wb_cyc_i remains high.\n\nBut the user mentioned not to create new signals, so maybe focus on the stability of wb_cyc_i during the transaction.\n\nAnother point from the spec: The core\'s WISHBONE interface is classic, meaning that each transfer is a single read or write, and the cycle (wb_cyc_i) is asserted for the duration of the transfer. So once a transfer starts (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i high), wb_cyc_i should stay high until the transfer completes (wb_ack_o high).\n\nSo an assertion could be: Once wb_cyc_i is high and wb_stb_i is high, wb_cyc_i remains high until wb_ack_o is high.\n\nAlso, after wb_ack_o is high, wb_cyc_i can either stay high (for another transaction) or go low. But during the transaction, it must stay high.\n\nAnother thing: The WISHBONE standard says that wb_cyc_i must be asserted for the entire duration of the bus cycle. So any time wb_stb_i is asserted, wb_cyc_i must also be asserted. So an assertion that whenever wb_stb_i is high, wb_cyc_i is also high.\n\nPutting this all together, the SVAs would be:\n\nWidth: Check 1-bit.\n\nConnectivity:\n- If wb_stb_i is high, then wb_cyc_i must be high.\n- When wb_cyc_i is low, wb_ack_o is low.\n\nFunctionality:\n- Once wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, they stay high until wb_ack_o is high.\n- After reset, wb_cyc_i is low until a transaction starts.\n- During a transaction (wb_cyc_i high and wb_stb_i high), the address and data inputs are stable until ack.\n\nBut the last point about address and data stability might involve other signals like wb_adr_i and wb_dat_i, which are part of the related signals. Since the user allows using related signals, that\'s acceptable.\n\nSo, the assertions would look like:\n\n// Width assertion\nassert property ($bits(wb_cyc_i) == 1);\n\n// Connectivity: wb_stb_i implies wb_cyc_i\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_stb_i |-> wb_cyc_i);\n\n// Connectivity: When cyc is low, ack is low\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) !wb_cyc_i |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\n// Functionality: cyc and stb stay high until ack\nproperty cyc_stb_until_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) throughout (##[1:2] wb_ack_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (cyc_stb_until_ack);\n\n// Functionality: After reset, cyc is low\n// This might be tricky because after reset, the signal could be anything until a transaction starts. But the core\'s WISHBONE is a slave, so it\'s the master that asserts cyc. So maybe not applicable here. Alternatively, check that during reset, cyc is low. But the reset here is synchronous (wb_rst_i). So:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_rst_i |-> !wb_cyc_i);\n\nWait, but wb_cyc_i is an input to the core, so the core doesn\'t control it. The core\'s master (the system controlling it) asserts wb_cyc_i. So the core can\'t enforce that after reset wb_cyc_i is low. That\'s up to the master. Therefore, that assertion might not be valid because the core can\'t control the input. So maybe skip that.\n\nInstead, check that during a reset, if wb_cyc_i is asserted, then the core ignores it. But that\'s more complex. Alternatively, since the core is a slave, when reset is active, it should not respond, so maybe wb_ack_o should remain low during reset regardless of wb_cyc_i. But that\'s more about wb_ack_o behavior.\n\nHmm, perhaps the functionality assertion should focus on the core\'s response. For example, during reset, the core does not acknowledge any transaction, so even if wb_cyc_i is high, wb_ack_o remains low. But that\'s more about wb_ack_o than wb_cyc_i.\n\nGiven that, maybe the functionality assertions for wb_cyc_i are:\n\n- Once a transaction starts (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i high), it remains high until ack is received.\n- Transactions take two cycles, so after wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, ack comes in two cycles.\n\nBut how to model that? For example:\n\n// Check that ack occurs exactly two cycles after cyc and stb are asserted\nproperty ack_in_two_cycles;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> ##2 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (ack_in_two_cycles);\n\nBut the spec says each access takes two clock cycles. So this assertion would check that. However, this depends on the core\'s design. If the core\'s WISHBONE interface indeed takes two cycles, then this is valid. But since the user provided that information, it\'s correct to include it.\n\nAdditionally, during those two cycles, wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i must remain high. So combining both:\n\nOnce cyc and stb are high, they stay high for two cycles until ack is asserted.\n\nSo:\n\nproperty cyc_stb_stable;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> ##1 (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (cyc_stb_stable);\n\nThis ensures that after cyc and stb are high, they stay high for the next cycle, and in the second cycle, ack is high.\n\nAnother point: When ack is high, cyc can stay high or go low. But during the two cycles, cyc must stay high.\n\nAlso, during the transaction, the address and data inputs (wb_adr_i, wb_dat_i, wb_we_i) should remain stable. So:\n\n// During a transaction, address and data are stable\nproperty addr_data_stable;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |-> ##1 (wb_adr_i == $past(wb_adr_i) && wb_dat_i == $past(wb_dat_i) && wb_we_i == $past(wb_we_i)) ##0 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (addr_data_stable);\n\nBut this might be more related to the WISHBONE protocol rather than the core\'s specific behavior. However, the spec mentions that all outputs are registered and each access takes two cycles. So the inputs (address, data, we) should be stable during those two cycles.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would include:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. Connectivity: stb implies cyc.\n3. Connectivity: cyc low implies ack low.\n4. Functionality: cyc and stb remain high until ack in two cycles.\n5. Functionality: address/data stability during transaction.\n\nBut need to ensure that all assertions are correct and don\'t introduce new signals.\n\nFinal list of assertions for wb_cyc_i:\n\n- Width: 1 bit.\n- Connectivity: If wb_stb_i is high, wb_cyc_i must be high.\n- Connectivity: When wb_cyc_i is low, wb_ack_o is low.\n- Functionality: Once wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, they remain high until wb_ack_o is asserted two cycles later.\n- Functionality: During the transaction (from cyc and stb high to ack high), address and data inputs are stable.\n\nNow, translating these into SVA:\n\nFor the two-cycle access:\n\nproperty two_cycle_access;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |=> (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (two_cycle_access);\n\nThis uses |=> to check that in the next cycle, cyc and stb are still high, then in the following cycle, ack is high.\n\nFor address/data stability:\n\nproperty input_stability;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |=> (wb_adr_i == $past(wb_adr_i,1) && wb_dat_i == $past(wb_dat_i,1) && wb_we_i == $past(wb_we_i,1));\nendproperty\nassert property (input_stability);\n\nThis checks that in the cycle after cyc and stb are high, the address, data, and we signals remain the same as they were in the previous cycle.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be as follows.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: Verify `wb_cyc_i` is 1-bit wide.\n2. **Connectivity**:\n   - `wb_stb_i` (strobe) must only be active when `wb_cyc_i` is high (WISHBONE rule).\n   - `wb_ack_o` (acknowledge) must be low when `wb_cyc_i` is inactive.\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - `wb_cyc_i` remains high until the transaction completes (2 cycles with `wb_ack_o`).\n   - Address/data inputs (`wb_adr_i`, `wb_dat_i`, `wb_we_i`) remain stable during the transaction.\n   - Transaction completes in exactly 2 cycles after `wb_cyc_i` and `wb_stb_i` are asserted.\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check using `$bits`.\n- **Connectivity**: Implication checks between `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_stb_i`, and `wb_ack_o`.\n- **Functionality**: Stability and timing checks using sequences and `$past`.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion: wb_cyc_i must be 1-bit wide\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) ($bits(wb_cyc_i) == 1));\n\n// Connectivity: wb_stb_i can only be active when wb_cyc_i is high\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_stb_i |-> wb_cyc_i);\n\n// Connectivity: No acknowledge when cycle is inactive\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) !wb_cyc_i |-> !wb_ack_o);\n\n// Functionality: wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i remain high until ack in 2 cycles\nproperty cyc_stb_until_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |=> (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (cyc_stb_until_ack);\n\n// Functionality: Address/data stability during transaction\nproperty input_stability;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |=> (wb_adr_i == $past(wb_adr_i) && wb_dat_i == $past(wb_dat_i) && wb_we_i == $past(wb_we_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (input_stability);\n```.\n\nAccording to the Feedback: <think>\n\nOkay, let\'s analyze the provided SVAs for `wb_cyc_i` step by step, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, and potential flaws. Here\'s the breakdown:\n\n### **1. Width Assertion**\n```systemverilog\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) ($bits(wb_cyc_i) == 1));\n```\n- **Correctness**: Valid. Checks the signal is 1-bit wide as per spec.\n- **Flaw**: Missing `disable iff (wb_rst_i)`. If the system is in reset, this assertion might fire unnecessarily during initialization.\n- **Score Impact**: Minor deduction (-5). Not critical but could cause false negatives during reset.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Connectivity: `wb_stb_i` Implies `wb_cyc_i`**\n```systemverilog\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) wb_stb_i |-> wb_cyc_i);\n```\n- **Correctness**: Correct. WISHBONE requires `wb_stb_i` to be valid only when `wb_cyc_i` is high.\n- **Flaw**: Missing `disable iff (wb_rst_i)`. During reset, `wb_stb_i` could be glitchy, leading to false failures.\n- **Score Impact**: Moderate deduction (-10). Reset handling is critical for robustness.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Connectivity: `wb_cyc_i` Low → `wb_ack_o` Low**\n```systemverilog\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) !wb_cyc_i |-> !wb_ack_o);\n```\n- **Correctness**: Correct. The core should not acknowledge transactions when `wb_cyc_i` is inactive.\n- **Flaw**: Missing `disable iff (wb_rst_i)`. During reset, `wb_ack_o` might not be driven, causing false failures.\n- **Score Impact**: Moderate deduction (-10). Reset exclusion needed.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Functionality: `wb_cyc_i` Stability Until `wb_ack_o`**\n```systemverilog\nproperty cyc_stb_until_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |=> (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (cyc_stb_until_ack);\n```\n- **Correctness**: Partially correct. Ensures `wb_cyc_i` and `wb_stb_i` stay high for 2 cycles until `wb_ack_o`.\n- **Flaws**:\n  - **Overconstraining**: WISHBONE allows `wb_stb_i` to deassert earlier if the master supports pipelining. The assertion forces `wb_stb_i` to stay high for both cycles, which is not strictly required by the standard.\n  - **Timing**: The spec states transactions take 2 cycles, but the assertion uses `##1` (1 cycle delay), which would check for `wb_ack_o` in the *second* cycle. However, `|=>` checks the next cycle, so `##1` after `|=>` totals 2 cycles. This is correct but could be clarified.\n- **Score Impact**: Major deduction (-20). Overconstraining `wb_stb_i` violates WISHBONE flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Functionality: Address/Data Stability**\n```systemverilog\nproperty input_stability;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i) |=> (wb_adr_i == $past(wb_adr_i) && wb_dat_i == $past(wb_dat_i) && wb_we_i == $past(wb_we_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (input_stability);\n```\n- **Correctness**: Correct for the core’s 2-cycle access. Inputs must remain stable until `wb_ack_o`.\n- **Flaw**: Does not cover the entire transaction duration. The assertion checks stability only in the cycle after `wb_cyc_i` and `wb_stb_i` are asserted, but inputs must stay stable until `wb_ack_o` is received (2 cycles).\n- **Score Impact**: Moderate deduction (-15). Incomplete coverage of stability period.\n\n---\n\n### **Missing Assertions**\n1. **Reset Behavior**: No check that `wb_cyc_i` is ignored during reset (e.g., `wb_rst_i` → `wb_ack_o` is low regardless of `wb_cyc_i`).\n2. **Post-Transaction Behavior**: No check if `wb_cyc_i` can deassert after `wb_ack_o` or remain high for pipelined transactions.\n3. **Glitch Prevention**: Missing check that `wb_cyc_i` does not toggle during a transaction (e.g., once high, it stays high until `wb_ack_o`).\n\n---\n\n### **Clock Cycle Misinterpretations**\n- The assertion `cyc_stb_until_ack` uses `|=>` (next cycle) and `##1`, which correctly models the 2-cycle transaction. No misinterpretation here.\n- However, the stability assertion only checks one cycle instead of the full 2-cycle window.\n\n---\n\n### **Nested Conditions & Long Expressions**\n- The `input_stability` property uses a long conjunction (`wb_adr_i == $past(...) && wb_dat_i == $past(...) && ...`). While acceptable, it could be split into separate assertions for clarity and debuggability.\n\n---\n\n### **Score Calculation**\n- **Total Score**: 100 (baseline).\n- **Deductions**:\n  - Missing `disable iff` in 3 assertions: -5 (width) -10 (stb→cyc) -10 (ack) = -25.\n  - Overconstraining `wb_stb_i`: -20.\n  - Incomplete input stability: -15.\n  - Missing reset/post-transaction checks: -20.\n- **Final Score**: 100 - 70 = **30/100**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations**\n1. Add `disable iff (wb_rst_i)` to all assertions.\n2. Relax `wb_stb_i` stability in `cyc_stb_until_ack` to allow pipelining.\n3. Extend `input_stability` to cover both cycles of the transaction.\n4. Add assertions for reset behavior and post-ack `wb_cyc_i` transitions.\n5. Split long conditions into separate assertions for clarity..

Since the parity error is issued in the next clock cycle of a data phase and the parity error is normally asserted for 2 clock cycles, this extension is necessary for the checker. Figure 6-14 shows a sample waveform of this check in a simulation. Marker 1 shows that the master has asserted the signal "framen" and issued the command "0001" on the c/be bus indicating that it is a special cycle. Note that the signal "perm," which indicates a parity error, remains de-asserted irrespective of what the "par" bit value is. Hence, the checker succeeds.

Alright, let's tackle generating the SVAs for `wb_cyc_i` based on the feedback and additional context provided. 

First, I need to address the issues pointed out in the feedback:
1. **Missing `disable iff (wb_rst_i)`**: All assertions should include this to avoid false triggers during reset.
2. **Overconstraining `wb_stb_i`**: The original assertion forced `wb_stb_i` to stay high for two cycles, but WISHBONE allows pipelining where `wb_stb_i` can deassert earlier. Need to relax this.
3. **Incomplete input stability check**: The stability assertion only checked one cycle instead of the full two-cycle transaction.
4. **Missing reset/post-transaction checks**: Add assertions to ensure `wb_cyc_i` behaves correctly during reset and after `wb_ack_o`.

**Step 1: Fix Existing Assertions**
- **Width Assertion**: Add `disable iff`.
- **Connectivity Assertions**: Add `disable iff` to both.
- **Functionality Assertions**:
  - **`cyc_stb_until_ack`**: Remove `wb_stb_i` from the consequent to allow pipelining. Only check `wb_cyc_i` remains high until `wb_ack_o`.
  - **`input_stability`**: Extend to cover both cycles of the transaction using `throughout`.

**Step 2: Add Missing Assertions**
- **Reset Behavior**: Ensure `wb_cyc_i` is ignored during reset (no `wb_ack_o`).
- **Post-Transaction Behavior**: Check `wb_cyc_i` can deassert or stay high after `wb_ack_o`.
- **Glitch Prevention**: Ensure `wb_cyc_i` doesn’t toggle mid-transaction.

**Step 3: Split Long Conditions**
- Separate address, data, and `wb_we_i` stability into individual assertions for clarity.

**Final SVAs**:
- **Width**: Check 1-bit width with reset exclusion.
- **Connectivity**: `wb_stb_i` implies `wb_cyc_i`; `wb_ack_o` low when `wb_cyc_i` low.
- **Functionality**:
  - `wb_cyc_i` remains high until `wb_ack_o` (allowing `wb_stb_i` to deassert).
  - Address/data stability throughout the transaction.
  - Transaction completes in exactly 2 cycles.
  - No `wb_cyc_i` toggling during transaction.
  - Reset handling: `wb_ack_o` low during reset regardless of `wb_cyc_i`.

This ensures compliance with WISHBONE specs and addresses all feedback points.
