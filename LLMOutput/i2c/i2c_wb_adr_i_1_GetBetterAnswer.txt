It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

The Byte Command Controller tells the Bit Command Controller\nwhich operation has to be performed. For a single byte read, the Bit Command Controller\nreceives 8 separate read commands. Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle generating SVAs for the wb_adr_i signal based on the provided information. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the three main types of assertions: width, connectivity, and functionality. \n\nStarting with the width assertion. The description says wb_adr_i is a 3-bit wide input. So, I should check that the signal's width is indeed 3 bits. Using $bits(wb_adr_i) should equal 3.\n\nNext, connectivity. The signal is part of the WISHBONE interface and interacts with other signals like wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, etc. The address decoding logic uses wb_adr_i along with these signals to access registers. So, when the core is selected (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), the address should be valid. But how to check that? Maybe when a valid transaction is happening (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active), the address should be within the valid range (0x00 to 0x04). Since it's 3 bits, the maximum value is 5 (binary 101), but the spec mentions addresses up to 0x04, which is 4 in decimal. Wait, 3 bits can go up to 7 (0x07), but the core only uses up to 0x04. So, during valid transactions, the address should be <= 4. But the spec says addresses 0x00 to 0x04. Wait, 0x04 is address 4 in hex, which is 100 in binary. Since wb_adr_i is 3 bits, the valid addresses are 0 to 4 (0x00 to 0x04). So, the address should be between 0 and 4 inclusive. So, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, wb_adr_i should be <= 4. But since it's 3 bits, the maximum possible value is 7, but the core only uses up to 4. So, any address above 4 would be invalid. So the connectivity assertion would check that during a valid transaction, the address is within the valid range.\n\nFor functionality, the address should remain stable during a valid transaction. Since WISHBONE is a synchronous interface, during a valid cycle (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), the address shouldn't change until the transaction completes (when wb_ack_o is asserted). But how to model that? Maybe check that once the transaction starts (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i go high), the address remains stable until wb_ack_o is received. However, the spec mentions that each access takes 2 clock cycles. So, during those two cycles, the address should not change. Alternatively, since the address is registered, perhaps it's sufficient that when the strobe is active, the address is stable. But the exact behavior depends on the WISHBONE protocol. The WISHBONE classic cycle requires that the address remains valid until wb_ack_o is asserted. So, during a cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i high), the address should stay constant until wb_ack_o is high. But since the core's access takes two cycles, maybe the address is latched on the first cycle. However, the SVA needs to check that during the active transaction, the address doesn't change. So, a property that once wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, wb_adr_i remains the same until wb_ack_o is high.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth: Check that wb_adr_i is 3 bits.\n\nConnectivity: When wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are active, address is within 0-4.\n\nFunctionality: During a valid transaction, address remains stable until acknowledged.\n\nAlso, need to consider reset conditions. The asynchronous reset arst_i and synchronous reset wb_rst_i. But the assertions should account for reset states. However, the problem statement says not to create new signals, so maybe the assertions are only active when not in reset.\n\nNow, writing the SVAs:\n\nWidth assertion:\n\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_adr_i) == 3);\n\nConnectivity:\n\nWhen wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, wb_adr_i should be <=4. So:\n\nproperty valid_address;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> (wb_adr_i <= 4);\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_address);\n\nFunctionality: Address stability during transaction. Once the transaction starts (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i high), the address should not change until ack is received. Since the core takes two cycles, but the WISHBONE protocol requires the address to be stable until ack. So:\n\nproperty addr_stable_during_transfer;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i) // assuming active high resets\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && !wb_ack_o) |=> $stable(wb_adr_i) throughout (wb_ack_o [->1]);\nendproperty\nassert property (addr_stable_during_transfer);\n\nBut the 'throughout' might be tricky. Alternatively, check that once the transaction starts, the address remains stable until ack is received. Using a sequence:\n\nsequence transaction;\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) ##0 (!wb_ack_o) [*] ##1 wb_ack_o;\nendsequence\n\nproperty addr_stable;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> $stable(wb_adr_i) until_within wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\n\nAlternatively, using consecutive cycles:\n\nOnce wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, in the next cycles until wb_ack_o, the address should stay the same.\n\nBut maybe a simpler approach: during any cycle where wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high and wb_ack_o is not yet asserted, the address should not change in the next cycle unless ack occurs.\n\nBut this might be complex. Alternatively, check that from the start of the transaction (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i high) until ack, the address remains the same.\n\nAnother approach: If wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high and not in reset, then in the same cycle, the address is valid (connectivity), and in the next cycle, if the transaction is still ongoing (ack not received), the address remains the same.\n\nBut since the WISHBONE transaction is two cycles, perhaps the address is only sampled on the first cycle. However, the specification says each access takes two cycles, but the address might need to be held for both cycles. So the address should remain stable until ack is received.\n\nSo, the property could be:\n\nOnce a transaction starts (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i), the address remains stable until wb_ack_o is asserted.\n\nUsing:\n\nproperty addr_stability;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)\n  $rose(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> ##[0:1] $stable(wb_adr_i) until wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\n\nBut the 'until' operator might not be straightforward. Alternatively, check that from the start of the transaction until ack, the address doesn't change.\n\nAnother way: For every cycle where wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high and ack is not yet received, the address should be the same as in the previous cycle.\n\nSo:\n\nproperty addr_stable_during_transfer;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && !wb_ack_o) |=> $stable(wb_adr_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (addr_stable_during_transfer);\n\nThis checks that if in a cycle, the transaction is active but ack hasn't been received, then in the next cycle, the address remains the same. But this only covers one cycle at a time. However, since the transaction takes two cycles, this would cover the necessary check.\n\nPutting it all together, the SVAs would be:\n\n- Width check\n- Valid address range during active transaction\n- Address stability during active transaction until ack\n\nAlso, considering resets, the assertions should be disabled during reset.\n\nNow, checking for syntax and correctness.\n\nFor the width assertion: correct.\n\nFor connectivity: when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, address <=4.\n\nFor functionality: address stability during transaction.\n\nYes, these cover the necessary aspects.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: Verify `wb_adr_i` is 3 bits wide using `$bits`.\n2. **Connectivity**: Ensure valid addresses (0x00-0x04) are used when the WISHBONE interface is active (`wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` high).\n3. **Functionality**: Check address stability during active transactions until acknowledgment (`wb_ack_o`).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check using `$bits`.\n- **Connectivity**: Assert valid address range during active cycles.\n- **Functionality**: Ensure address remains stable until transaction completion (acknowledgment).\n\n[Answer]\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion for wb_adr_i\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_adr_i) == 3);\n\n// Connectivity: Valid address range during active WISHBONE transactions\nproperty valid_address_range;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> (wb_adr_i inside {0,1,2,3,4});\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_address_range);\n\n// Functionality: Address stability during active transaction\nproperty address_stability;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && !wb_ack_o) |=> $stable(wb_adr_i);\nendproperty\nassert property (address_stability);\n```"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at the SVAs provided for the `wb_adr_i` signal. The user wants me to critique them strictly based on correctness, consistency, completeness, and potential issues like clock cycle misinterpretations or complex conditions.\n\nFirst, the **Connectivity Assertion** checks that during active transactions (`wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` high), the address is within 0-4. That seems correct. But wait, the specification says addresses are 0x00 to 0x04, which are 0-4 in decimal. However, `wb_adr_i` is a 3-bit signal, so technically, the maximum value it can hold is 7 (3'b111). The assertion uses `inside {0,1,2,3,4}`, which covers all valid addresses. That's okay, but maybe using a range like `[0:4]` would be clearer. Also, the spec mentions that reserved bits in registers should be written as zeros. But since this is an address input, maybe there's no need for that here. So the connectivity check is correct but could be written more concisely.\n\nNext, the **Functionality Assertion** uses `$stable(wb_adr_i) until wb_ack_o`. The intention is to ensure the address remains stable until acknowledgment. However, the `until` operator in SVA has specific semantics. `a until b` means that `a` must hold true continuously until `b` occurs, and `b` must eventually happen. In this case, if `wb_ack_o` never comes (e.g., due to an error), the assertion would fail because `until` requires `b` to occur. But in the WISHBONE protocol, `wb_ack_o` is required to respond to every transaction, so maybe this is acceptable. However, the assertion is triggered only when the transaction starts (`wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i`). What if the transaction spans multiple cycles? The `until` here might not cover the entire duration correctly. Also, `$stable` checks that the value doesn't change from the previous cycle. But when the transaction starts, the address should remain stable from the cycle it starts until `wb_ack_o` is received. The current assertion uses `|->`, which checks the condition starting at the next cycle. Maybe it should check stability starting from the same cycle when the transaction begins.\n\nAnother point: The spec mentions that each WISHBONE access takes two clock cycles. Does this affect the address stability? The address should be held stable for the entire transaction, which might be more than one cycle. The current assertion uses `until wb_ack_o`, which should cover the entire duration, but if `wb_ack_o` can come in the same cycle as the transaction starts, the `until` might not capture the necessary stability. Also, the use of `disable iff` for both `wb_rst_i` and `arst_i` is correct, as per the spec's asynchronous reset handling.\n\nPotential flaws:\n1. **Stability Check Timing**: The assertion checks stability from the cycle after the transaction starts (`|->`), but the address must be stable from the start cycle itself. Using `##0` or checking stability in the same cycle might be needed.\n2. **Address Range Expression**: Using `inside {[0:4]}` is more readable than listing all values.\n3. **Handling of Unacknowledged Transactions**: If `wb_ack_o` is delayed or not received, the `until` might not behave as intended. However, WISHBONE requires acknowledgment, so this might be a non-issue.\n4. **Multi-Cycle Transactions**: The spec says each access takes two cycles. The stability assertion should ensure the address is stable across both cycles until `wb_ack_o` is received. The current assertion should handle this, but it's worth verifying.\n\nImprovements:\n- Modify the stability check to start from the same cycle the transaction begins.\n- Use a range syntax for the address check.\n- Ensure that the `until` correctly covers all cycles until acknowledgment, including the cycle where `wb_ack_o` is asserted.\n</think>\n\n**Feedback on SVAs for `wb_adr_i`**  \n**Score: 85/100**  \n\n### **1.

This misses the first cycle of the transaction.  \n- **Clock Cycle Misinterpretation**: The spec states WISHBONE transactions take **2 cycles**, but the assertion does not enforce stability during the entire transaction.  \n\n**Example Failure Scenario:**  \nIf `wb_adr_i` changes in the first cycle of `wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i`, the assertion passes because it checks stability starting from the next cycle.  \n\n**Improvements:**  \n```systemverilog\nproperty address_stability;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> ##[0:1] $stable(wb_adr_i) throughout (wb_cyc_i[->1] ##0 wb_ack_o);\nendproperty\n```  \n**Explanation:**  \n- `##[0:1]` ensures stability is checked starting from the **current cycle** (same cycle as transaction start).  \n- `throughout` enforces stability until `wb_ack_o` arrives, covering all intermediate cycles.  \n\n---\n\n### **3.

The revised assertions maintain correct syntax.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: Removed redundant runtime check (handled during synthesis).\n2. **Connectivity**: Maintained valid address range check during active transactions.\n3. **Functionality**: Enhanced to ensure stability until acknowledgment using `until`.\n\n[Verification]\n- **Connectivity**: Validates address range 0x00-0x04 during active cycles.\n- **Functionality**: Ensures address remains stable throughout the transaction.\n\n[Answer]\n```systemverilog\n// [Connectivity] Valid address range during active transactions\nproperty valid_address_range;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> (wb_adr_i inside {0,1,2,3,4});\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_address_range);\n\n// [Functionality] Address stability until acknowledgment\nproperty address_stability;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> $stable(wb_adr_i) until wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nassert property (address_stability);\n```.\n\nAccording to the Feedback: <think>\nOkay, let\'s take a look at the SVAs provided for the `wb_adr_i` signal. The user wants me to critique them strictly based on correctness, consistency, completeness, and potential issues like clock cycle misinterpretations or complex conditions.\n\nFirst, the **Connectivity Assertion** checks that during active transactions (`wb_stb_i` and `wb_cyc_i` high), the address is within 0-4. That seems correct. But wait, the specification says addresses are 0x00 to 0x04, which are 0-4 in decimal. However, `wb_adr_i` is a 3-bit signal, so technically, the maximum value it can hold is 7 (3\'b111). The assertion uses `inside {0,1,2,3,4}`, which covers all valid addresses. That\'s okay, but maybe using a range like `[0:4]` would be clearer. Also, the spec mentions that reserved bits in registers should be written as zeros. But since this is an address input, maybe there\'s no need for that here. So the connectivity check is correct but could be written more concisely.\n\nNext, the **Functionality Assertion** uses `$stable(wb_adr_i) until wb_ack_o`. The intention is to ensure the address remains stable until acknowledgment. However, the `until` operator in SVA has specific semantics. `a until b` means that `a` must hold true continuously until `b` occurs, and `b` must eventually happen. In this case, if `wb_ack_o` never comes (e.g., due to an error), the assertion would fail because `until` requires `b` to occur. But in the WISHBONE protocol, `wb_ack_o` is required to respond to every transaction, so maybe this is acceptable. However, the assertion is triggered only when the transaction starts (`wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i`). What if the transaction spans multiple cycles? The `until` here might not cover the entire duration correctly. Also, `$stable` checks that the value doesn\'t change from the previous cycle. But when the transaction starts, the address should remain stable from the cycle it starts until `wb_ack_o` is received. The current assertion uses `|->`, which checks the condition starting at the next cycle. Maybe it should check stability starting from the same cycle when the transaction begins.\n\nAnother point: The spec mentions that each WISHBONE access takes two clock cycles. Does this affect the address stability? The address should be held stable for the entire transaction, which might be more than one cycle. The current assertion uses `until wb_ack_o`, which should cover the entire duration, but if `wb_ack_o` can come in the same cycle as the transaction starts, the `until` might not capture the necessary stability. Also, the use of `disable iff` for both `wb_rst_i` and `arst_i` is correct, as per the spec\'s asynchronous reset handling.\n\nPotential flaws:\n1. **Stability Check Timing**: The assertion checks stability from the cycle after the transaction starts (`|->`), but the address must be stable from the start cycle itself. Using `##0` or checking stability in the same cycle might be needed.\n2. **Address Range Expression**: Using `inside {[0:4]}` is more readable than listing all values.\n3. **Handling of Unacknowledged Transactions**: If `wb_ack_o` is delayed or not received, the `until` might not behave as intended. However, WISHBONE requires acknowledgment, so this might be a non-issue.\n4. **Multi-Cycle Transactions**: The spec says each access takes two cycles. The stability assertion should ensure the address is stable across both cycles until `wb_ack_o` is received. The current assertion should handle this, but it\'s worth verifying.\n\nImprovements:\n- Modify the stability check to start from the same cycle the transaction begins.\n- Use a range syntax for the address check.\n- Ensure that the `until` correctly covers all cycles until acknowledgment, including the cycle where `wb_ack_o` is asserted.\n</think>\n\n**Feedback on SVAs for `wb_adr_i`**  \n**Score: 85/100**  \n\n### **1. Connectivity Assertion**  \n**Flaws:**  \n- **Range Syntax**: Using `inside {0,1,2,3,4}` is valid but less readable than `inside {[0:4]}`.  \n- **Incomplete Reset Handling**: The spec allows asynchronous reset (`arst_i`) to override `wb_rst_i`, but the assertion disables for either. This is correct but could be clarified.  \n\n**Improvements:**  \n```systemverilog\nproperty valid_address_range;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i || wb_rst_i) // Prioritize async reset\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> (wb_adr_i inside {[0:4]});\nendproperty\n```  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Functionality Assertion**  \n**Critical Flaws:**  \n- **Timing Misalignment**: `$stable(wb_adr_i) until wb_ack_o` checks stability **from the next cycle** after `wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i` (due to `|->`). This misses the first cycle of the transaction.  \n- **Clock Cycle Misinterpretation**: The spec states WISHBONE transactions take **2 cycles**, but the assertion does not enforce stability during the entire transaction.  \n\n**Example Failure Scenario:**  \nIf `wb_adr_i` changes in the first cycle of `wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i`, the assertion passes because it checks stability starting from the next cycle.  \n\n**Improvements:**  \n```systemverilog\nproperty address_stability;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> ##[0:1] $stable(wb_adr_i) throughout (wb_cyc_i[->1] ##0 wb_ack_o);\nendproperty\n```  \n**Explanation:**  \n- `##[0:1]` ensures stability is checked starting from the **current cycle** (same cycle as transaction start).  \n- `throughout` enforces stability until `wb_ack_o` arrives, covering all intermediate cycles.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Completeness**  \n**Missing Assertions:**  \n- **Post-Reset Stability**: No check for `wb_adr_i` stability during reset (e.g., `wb_adr_i` should not change while `arst_i` or `wb_rst_i` is active).  \n- **Unused Address Bits**: The spec says unused address bits (beyond 3 bits) should be ignored, but no assertion enforces this.  \n\n**Example Missing SVA:**  \n```systemverilog\n// Ensure upper address bits are ignored (if wb_adr_i >3 bits)\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (|wb_adr_i[7:3]) == 0); \n```  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Score Rationale**  \n- **Correctness**: 90% (Stability timing misalignment is critical).  \n- **Consistency**: 95% (Matches spec but misses edge cases).  \n- **Completeness**: 70% (Missing checks for reset behavior and unused bits).  \n- **Creativity**: +0 (No novel edge cases addressed).  \n\n**Action Items:**  \n1. Fix timing alignment in stability assertion.  \n2. Add assertions for reset behavior and unused address bits.. Here are the syntax error report for each signal: {\'property valid_address_range;\\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)\\n  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> (wb_adr_i inside {0,1,2,3,4});\\nendproperty\\nassert property (valid_address_range);\': \'No Syntax Errors Found.

LLM Output: <think>
Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `wb_adr_i` signal based on the provided specifications and previous feedback. Let me start by reviewing the specifications again to ensure I understand all requirements.

**Key Points from Specifications:**
- **wb_adr_i**: 3-bit input for addressing registers (0x00 to 0x04).
- **WISHBONE Interface**: Transactions involve `wb_stb_i` (strobe), `wb_cyc_i` (bus cycle), and `wb_ack_o` (acknowledge).
- **Functionality**: Address must remain stable during active transactions until acknowledgment.
- **Reset Handling**: Both synchronous (`wb_rst_i`) and asynchronous (`arst_i`) resets are present.

**Previous Feedback Summary:**
1. **Connectivity Assertion**: Use `inside {[0:4]}` for clarity instead of listing individual values.
2. **Functionality Assertion**: Ensure address stability starts from the same cycle the transaction begins, not the next cycle.
3. **Missing Assertions**: Check for unused address bits and stability during reset.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Connectivity Assertion**:
   - **Purpose**: Ensure that during active transactions (`wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i`), the address is within the valid range (0x00-0x04).
   - **Improvement**: Replace `{0,1,2,3,4}` with `{[0:4]}` for better readability.
   - **Reset Handling**: Use `disable iff` to account for both resets, prioritizing asynchronous reset as per spec.

2. **Functionality Assertion**:
   - **Issue**: Previous assertion checked stability starting from the next cycle (`|->`), missing the first cycle.
   - **Fix**: Use `##[0:1]` to start checking stability in the same cycle the transaction begins.
   - **Coverage**: Use `throughout` to ensure stability persists until `wb_ack_o` is received, covering multi-cycle transactions.

3. **Additional Assertions**:
   - **Unused Address Bits**: The spec mentions only lower 3 bits are used. Assert that higher bits (if any) are zero.
   - **Reset Stability**: Ensure address doesn't change during reset conditions.

**Potential Pitfalls:**
- **Timing Misalignment**: Without `##[0:1]`, the stability check might miss the first cycle, leading to false positives.
- **Unused Bits**: Ignoring higher bits could allow invalid addresses to propagate unnoticed.

**Final Adjustments:**
- Refine syntax for clarity and correctness.
- Ensure all assertions are disabled during resets to avoid false failures.

**Verification:**
- **Connectivity**: Valid addresses during active transactions.
- **Functionality**: Stability from transaction start until acknowledgment.
- **Completeness**: Address higher bits and reset behavior.
</think>

[Reasoning Process]
1. **Connectivity**: Ensure `wb_adr_i` is within 0x00-0x04 during active transactions.
2. **Functionality**: Address stability from transaction start until acknowledgment.
3. **Completeness**: Check for unused address bits and reset behavior.

[Verification]
- **Connectivity**: Valid address range during active cycles.
- **Functionality**: Stability throughout transaction duration.
- **Completeness**: Address higher bits ignored, stability during reset.

```systemverilog
// [Connectivity] Valid address range (0x00-0x04) during active transactions

// [Functionality] Address stability from transaction start until acknowledgment
property address_stability;

endproperty
assert property (address_stability);

// [Completeness] Unused address bits (if any) must be zero
generate if ($bits(wb_adr_i) > 3) begin
  property unused_address_bits;
    @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i || wb_rst_i)
    (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> (wb_adr_i[$bits(wb_adr_i)-1:3] == 0);
  endproperty
  assert property (unused_address_bits);
