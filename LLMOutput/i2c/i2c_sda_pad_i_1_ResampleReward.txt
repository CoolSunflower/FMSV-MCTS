It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generated SVAs with Reasoning: Generate SVAs for sda_pad_i. \n[Signal name]: sda_pad_i\n[Description]:\n    [Definition]: 1-bit input signal representing the Serial Data (SDA) line input for the I2C interface.\n    [Functionality]: Samples the external SDA line state for data transfers in I2C communication. As part of an open-drain bus, it receives the logic level (pulled up externally by resistors) that reflects the current data on the SDA line.\n    [Interconnection]: Integrated in the external connections of the I2C interface; works with tri-state buffering elements (sda_pad_o and sda_pad_oe) to manage the bidirectional nature of the SDA signal. The internal SDA signal is connected to the physical bus via these buffers.\n    [Additional information]: Proper operation requires external pull-up resistors on the SDA line due to its open-drain configuration. In FPGA implementations, tri-state buffers may be automatically inserted to facilitate correct signal routing.\n[Related Signals]: sda_pad_o, sda_pad_oe, scl_pad_i, scl_pad_o, scl_pad_oe\nAnswer:<think>\n\nAlright, let\'s tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `sda_pad_i` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the issues identified in the previous answer. The main problems were:\n1. **Connectivity Assertion**: Didn\'t account for propagation delays and metastability.\n2. **Functionality Assertion**: Incorrectly referenced `scl_pad_i` instead of `scl_pad_o`, leading to potential false failures in multi-master scenarios.\n3. **Missing Checks**: No handling of START/STOP conditions, arbitration loss, or ACK/NACK.\n\n**Step 1: Width Assertion**\n- The width check is straightforward. `sda_pad_i` is defined as 1-bit, so the assertion remains valid. No changes needed here.\n\n**Step 2: Connectivity Assertion**\n- The original assertion assumed immediate equality between `sda_pad_i` and `sda_pad_o` when `sda_pad_oe` is low. However, in real hardware, there might be a delay due to tri-state buffers. To address this, I\'ll add a `##1` delay to account for one clock cycle propagation delay.\n- Also, include a disable condition for reset to avoid false failures during reset.\n\n**Step 3: Functionality Assertion**\n- The original assertion used `scl_pad_i` (input SCL), which isn\'t reliable in multi-master setups. Instead, use `scl_pad_o` (core-driven SCL) to check stability during SCL high phases.\n- Need to exclude START/STOP conditions. Since the core generates these, monitor the Command Register (`cr`) for STA (start) and STO (stop) commands. If either is active, allow SDA transitions during SCL high.\n- Use `$stable` to ensure SDA doesn\'t change unless during START/STOP.\n\n**Step 4: Arbitration Loss Check**\n- The status register (`sr`) has an Arbitration Lost (`AL`) bit. If another master drives SDA low while the core drives it high, `AL` should trigger. This can be checked by ensuring that when the core is driving (`sda_pad_oe` low), if `sda_pad_i` is low but `sda_pad_o` is high, `AL` is set in the next cycle.\n\n**Step 5: ACK/NACK Handling**\n- During read operations (when `sda_pad_oe` is high), the slave drives SDA. The core should capture this in the Receive Register (`rxr`). However, this is more about the status register and might not directly involve `sda_pad_i` assertions. Maybe skip this unless specified.\n\n**Step 6: START/STOP Condition Checks**\n- Add assertions to verify that START (SDA↓ while SCL high) and STOP (SDA↑ while SCL high) are correctly generated when the respective commands (STA, STO) are issued.\n\n**Final Adjustments**:\n- Use `disable iff (wb_rst_i)` to handle resets.\n- Ensure all assertions reference the correct signals (e.g., `scl_pad_o` instead of `scl_pad_i`).\n- Test for metastability by allowing a clock cycle delay in connectivity checks.\n\nBy addressing these points, the revised SVAs should be more robust and aligned with the specification and feedback.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion for sda_pad_i\n[width]\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) ($bits(sda_pad_i) == 1));\n\n// Connectivity: Account for 1-cycle buffer delay + metastability\n[connectivity]\nproperty sda_connectivity;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (wb_rst_i))\n  (sda_pad_oe == 1\'b0) |-> ##1 (sda_pad_i == sda_pad_o); // Buffer delay\nendproperty\nassert property (sda_connectivity);\n\n// Functionality: Stability during core-driven SCL high (exclude START/STOP)\n[functionality]\nproperty sda_stable_during_scl_high;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (wb_rst_i))\n  (scl_pad_oe == 1\'b0 && $fell(scl_pad_o)) |-> // Use CORE-DRIVEN SCL (scl_pad_o)\n  (sda_pad_oe == 1\'b0 && !(cr[3] || cr[2])) |-> // Exclude STA/STO commands\n  ($stable(sda_pad_i) throughout [0:1] scl_pad_o[->1]); // Stable for entire SCL high\nendproperty\nassert property (sda_stable_during_scl_high);\n\n// Arbitration loss check\n[functionality]\nproperty arbitration_loss;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (wb_rst_i))\n  (sda_pad_oe == 1\'b0 && sda_pad_o == 1\'b1 && sda_pad_i == 1\'b0) |=> \n  (sr[3] == 1\'b1); // AL bit set next cycle\nendproperty\nassert property (arbitration_loss);\n\n// START/STOP condition checks\n[functionality]\nproperty start_condition;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (wb_rst_i))\n  (cr[3] && scl_pad_o == 1\'b1) |-> // STA command + SCL high\n  (sda_pad_oe == 1\'b0 && $fell(sda_pad_i)); // SDA↓ during SCL high\nendproperty\nassert property (start_condition);\n\nproperty stop_condition;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (wb_rst_i))\n  (cr[2] && scl_pad_o == 1\'b1) |-> // STO command + SCL high\n  (sda_pad_oe == 1\'b0 && $rose(sda_pad_i)); // SDA↑ during SCL high\nendproperty\nassert property (stop_condition);\n``` \n\n**Key Improvements**:\n1. **Propagation Delay**: Added `##1` in connectivity assertion to model tri-state buffer latency.\n2. **Core-Driven SCL**: Replaced `scl_pad_i` with `scl_pad_o` to avoid multi-master interference.\n3. **START/STOP Exclusion**: Used Command Register (`cr[3:2]`) to disable stability checks during these events.\n4. **Arbitration Loss**: Directly checks if `AL` bit sets when core drives high but SDA is low.\n5. **Reset Handling**: Added `disable iff (wb_rst_i)` to all assertions.\n6. **Explicit START/STOP**: Added dedicated assertions to validate protocol-critical transitions.\n.

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, let's start by looking at the user's answer and the formal verification feedback. The user provided SVAs for the sda_pad_i signal, but the Jasper tool reported syntax errors. The main issues seem to be around the 'disable iff' clause and other syntax problems.

First, the connectivity assertion uses 'disable iff (wb_rst_i)', but the Jasper error says there's a syntax error near 'disable'. Maybe the tool doesn't support 'disable iff' in that context or there's a missing semicolon or parenthesis. The user might have misplaced the syntax here. Also, using '##1' assumes a one-cycle delay, but the specification mentions FPGA implementations with tri-state buffers, which might have variable delays. The assertion might not account for metastability properly, leading to potential false negatives.

Next, the functionality assertion for stability during SCL high references cr[3] and cr[2] (STA/STO commands). However, the specification states that STA and STO bits are automatically cleared. The assertion checks if these bits are not set, but if they are cleared immediately after being set, the condition might not hold as expected. Also, using $fell(scl_pad_o) might not correctly capture the SCL high phase duration. The 'throughout' clause with [0:1] scl_pad_o[->1] could be incorrect because SCL high might last more than one cycle, especially with clock stretching.

The arbitration loss property checks if AL bit is set in the next cycle. However, the specification mentions that arbitration loss is detected when the core drives SDA high but it's low. The user's assertion uses |=> (next cycle), but the actual detection might take longer due to internal processing. Also, the status register's AL bit might not update immediately in the next cycle, leading to a timing mismatch.

For the start and stop conditions, the assertions check if the core drives SDA low/high when STA/STO commands are active. However, the specification says that STA and STO bits are automatically cleared. The assertions might not account for the command bits being cleared before the condition is met, leading to false failures. Also, using $fell(sda_pad_i) and $rose(sda_pad_i) might not align with the actual SDA transitions controlled by the core's output enables.

The score is affected by syntax errors, incorrect assumptions about command bit lifetimes, improper handling of clock stretching and metastability, and potential timing mismatches. Each major flaw deducts points, leading to a low score.

[Analysis]  
The SVAs contain critical syntax errors (`disable iff` misuse), invalid references to automatically cleared command bits (STA/STO), and incorrect temporal assumptions about SCL/SDA timing. Key flaws:  
1. **Syntax Errors**: `disable iff` placement violates SV2012 rules (tool rejects it), rendering assertions non-compilable.  
2. **Command Bit Assumptions**: STA/STO bits auto-clear per spec, making `cr[3] || cr[2]` checks unreliable.  
3. **Clock Stretching Ignored**: Assertions assume fixed SCL timing, violating multi-master clock synchronization rules.  
4. **Metastability Risks**: `##1` in connectivity check is arbitrary; no synchronization for async SDA input.  
5. **Arbitration Timing**: `|=>` assumes AL bit updates in 1 cycle, but spec doesn’t guarantee this.  
6. **START/STOP Validity**: Fails to check if core actually owns the bus during condition generation.  

[Score]  
**-85/100**  
Catastrophic syntax errors (-30), protocol misinterpretations (-25), timing mismatches (-20), and metastability gaps (-10). Barely functional.
