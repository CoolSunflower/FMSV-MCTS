It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the signal wb_dat_i based on the provided specification and workflow. Let's start by understanding the role of wb_dat_i.\n\nFirst, the description says wb_dat_i is an 8-bit input that writes data into the core's registers. So, the width assertion is straightforward: check that it's always 8 bits. That's easy with $bits(wb_dat_i) == 8.\n\nNext, connectivity. The related signals are wb_adr_i, wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i. The WISHBONE interface requires that during a write cycle (when wb_we_i is high), and when the core is selected (wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), the data on wb_dat_i should be stable. So, I need an assertion that checks when all those control signals are active, wb_dat_i doesn't change until the transaction completes. But since WISHBONE is synchronous, maybe check that once the cycle starts, data remains stable until acknowledged. But the spec mentions each access takes 2 clock cycles. Wait, the WISHBONE interface is classic, with 2-cycle accesses. So during a write, when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, and wb_we_i is high, the data should be stable until wb_ack_o is asserted. But the user said not to create new signals, so maybe check that during a valid write transaction, data remains stable until the next cycle. Alternatively, since the data is sampled when the transaction is accepted, perhaps the data needs to be stable when the strobe is high. But the exact timing depends on the WISHBONE protocol. The WISHBONE spec says that for classic cycle, DAT_I must be valid when STB_I and CYC_I are high. So the connectivity assertion could ensure that when those signals are active, the data is within valid ranges for the addressed register. For example, when writing to the Prescale register (address 0x00 and 0x01), the data can be any 8-bit value. But the Control register (address 0x02) has specific bits (EN, IEN, others reserved). So maybe check that when writing to Control, bits other than EN and IEN are 0. But the problem is that the address is wb_adr_i, which is part of the related signals. However, the user said not to create new signals, but can use existing ones. So for functionality, when writing to Control register (wb_adr_i == 2), the data should have reserved bits as 0. Similarly, Command register (address 0x04) has certain bits that are writable (STA, STO, etc.), others are reserved. But the Command register's reserved bits should be written as 0. So functionality assertions would check that when writing to these registers, the reserved bits are 0. However, the user wants SVAs for wb_dat_i specifically. So maybe when the address is for Control or Command, certain bits of wb_dat_i are 0. For example, Control register bits 7:2 are reserved, so when writing to Control (wb_adr_i == 2), wb_dat_i[7:2] should be 0. Similarly, Command register bits 7:5 and bit 3 are reserved, so when writing to Command (wb_adr_i == 4), those bits should be 0. Also, when writing to Prescale registers (address 0 and 1), any value is allowed. Transmit register (address 3) is 8 bits, so all bits can be any value. So those are functional checks. \n\nFor connectivity, ensure that during a valid write transaction (wb_we_i high, wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i high), the data is stable. Wait, but in WISHBONE, the data must be valid when STB and CYC are high. So during a write, once STB and CYC are asserted, the data should remain stable until ACK is received. But since the core's WISHBONE interface takes 2 cycles, maybe the data is latched on the first cycle. The spec says all outputs are registered, each access takes 2 cycles. So perhaps the data is captured on the first cycle when STB and CYC are high. Therefore, the data should not change during the active transaction. But how to model that? An assertion that once STB and CYC are high, and WE is high, wb_dat_i remains stable until ACK is received. But since the user said not to use 'else' and the core might not have wb_ack_o in the signals list (wait, the mapping info includes wb_ack_o as an output). So the connectivity assertion could be: when a write transaction is active (wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i are high), wb_dat_i should remain stable until wb_ack_o is high. But since the transaction takes two cycles, maybe the data is captured on the first cycle, so the stability is only required during the address phase. Alternatively, the WISHBONE protocol requires that DAT_I remains valid until ACK_O is asserted. So the assertion would check that once the transaction starts (STB and CYC high), and WE is high, DAT_I doesn't change until ACK is received. But since the core's WISHBONE interface has wb_ack_o, which is part of the related signals, this can be used. So the property would be: during a write transaction, wb_dat_i remains stable until wb_ack_o is asserted. However, the exact timing depends on when wb_ack_o is generated. Since each access takes two cycles, perhaps wb_ack_o is asserted on the next cycle after STB and CYC are asserted. So the data needs to be stable during the first cycle. But maybe the data is sampled on the rising edge when STB and CYC are high, so the data only needs to be stable at that edge. But the problem is that the user wants connectivity checks, ensuring that the signal can be exercised and value propagated. So perhaps the connectivity assertion is that when a write is happening (wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i all high), the data is properly captured into the respective register based on the address. But how to check that? That's more of a functional check. Alternatively, the connectivity could be that the data is only considered when the write is active. So maybe an assertion that when a write occurs, the data is not X or Z. But the user might want to check that during a valid write, the data is stable. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check that wb_dat_i is 8 bits.\n\nConnectivity: When a write transaction is active (wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i high), wb_dat_i remains stable until the transaction completes (wb_ack_o high). But since wb_ack_o is an output, and the transaction takes two cycles, perhaps the data should remain stable during the address phase. Alternatively, the data is captured on the first cycle, so the assertion is that during the cycle where the write is active, the data doesn't change. But how to model that? Maybe using $stable(wb_dat_i) during the active write.\n\nFunctionality: When writing to Control register (address 2), reserved bits (7:2) are 0. When writing to Command register (address 4), reserved bits (7:5, 3) are 0. Also, when writing to Prescale registers (0 and 1), any value is allowed, and Transmit register (3) any value. So the functional assertions would check that when the address is for Control or Command, the corresponding reserved bits in wb_dat_i are 0.\n\nSo the SVAs would be:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(wb_dat_i) == 8);\n\n2. Connectivity: During a valid write transaction, data remains stable until ack. But since in WISHBONE, the data must be valid when STB and CYC are high, and the core samples it on the clock edge when those are high, perhaps the data should be stable during that cycle. So the assertion could be that once the write is active, the data doesn't change until the next clock edge. But since the transaction is two cycles, maybe the data is latched on the first cycle. So the assertion is that when wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i are high, wb_dat_i remains stable until wb_ack_o is high. However, implementing this requires checking that once the transaction starts, the data doesn't change until ack. But since ack comes in the next cycle, maybe:\n\nproperty wb_dat_i_stable;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> ##[0:1] $stable(wb_dat_i) throughout (wb_ack_o [->1]);\nendproperty\nBut this might be complex. Alternatively, check that during the cycle when the write is active, the data doesn't change. But since it's a single cycle (as per 2-cycle access), maybe the data is captured on the first cycle. So the assertion could be that when the write is active, the data is stable until the next cycle. But perhaps a simpler connectivity check is that when the write is active, the data is not X or Z. But the user didn't mention checking for X/Z, so maybe stick to stability.\n\nAlternatively, the connectivity assertion could be that when a write is happening, the data is stable during the same cycle. But since WISHBONE requires that the data is valid when STB and CYC are high, the data should be stable at the posedge when those signals are high. So the assertion is that when wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, and wb_cyc_i are high at the posedge, then wb_dat_i should be stable until the next posedge. But how to model that? Maybe:\n\nproperty wb_dat_i_connectivity;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> $stable(wb_dat_i) until_within wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nBut 'until_within' might not be standard. Alternatively, check that from the start of the transaction (wb_we_i, etc. high) until ack is received, the data doesn't change. But since ack comes in the next cycle, maybe:\n\nproperty wb_dat_i_connectivity;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  $rose(wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> $stable(wb_dat_i) until wb_ack_o;\nendproperty\nBut this might not be accurate. Alternatively, since the data is sampled on the same cycle as the address and control signals, the data only needs to be valid at that cycle. So the connectivity assertion is that during a write transaction, the data is valid (not necessarily stable beyond that cycle). But the user wants to check that the signal can be exercised and value propagated. So maybe the connectivity is covered by the functional checks.\n\nFor functionality, the main checks are on the Control and Command registers. So when writing to Control (wb_adr_i == 2), bits 7:2 must be 0. Similarly, when writing to Command (wb_adr_i == 4), bits 7:5 and bit 3 must be 0. So:\n\nFor Control register write:\n(wb_adr_i == 2) && wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i |-> wb_dat_i[7:2] == 0;\n\nFor Command register write:\n(wb_adr_i == 4) && wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i |-> (wb_dat_i[7:5] == 0 && wb_dat_i[3] == 0);\n\nAlso, the Transmit register (address 3) can have any value, so no restrictions there. Prescale registers (0 and 1) also any value.\n\nPutting all together, the SVAs would be:\n\nWidth assertion for 8 bits.\n\nConnectivity: Maybe that during a write, the data is stable when the control signals are active. But if the data is captured on the same cycle, perhaps no need for stability beyond that. So maybe the connectivity is implied by the functionality, but the user wants explicit connectivity checks. Alternatively, check that when the write is active, the data is not X. But the user didn't mention X checks. Alternatively, the connectivity is covered by the functional checks.\n\nSo the final SVAs are:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. Connectivity: When writing, data is stable during the active cycle.\n3.

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, let's take a look at the SVAs provided for the wb_dat_i signal. The user wants me to critique them strictly, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, clock cycle misinterpretations, nested conditions, and other possible flaws.

First, the width assertion uses assert_final with $bits. Wait, assert_final is a continuous check that runs at the end of simulation. But the spec says wb_dat_i is 8 bits, so this should be a static design-time check, not a simulation assertion. Using assert_final here might not be appropriate because it's not a temporal property. It should probably be a compile-time check or a 'bind' assertion with a static condition.

Next, the connectivity assertion checks stability until wb_ack_o. The property uses 'throughout' with a sequence that starts from the write transaction and continues until ack. But in WISHBONE, the ack can come in the same cycle as the request if the slave is ready. The 'throughout' might not capture cases where ack is immediate. Also, the sequence 1'b1 [*1:$] ##0 wb_ack_o could be simplified using 'until' operator. Additionally, the disable condition uses arst_i != ARST_LVL, but the spec mentions ARST_LVL is a parameter (0 or 1) determining the active level. The disable should check if arst_i is at its active level, not just not equal. For example, if ARST_LVL is 0 (active low), then disable when arst_i is 0. The current condition might not correctly handle the reset.

For the control register reserved bits, the mask is 8'hFC (bits 7:2). The spec says bits 7:2 are reserved in the control register. That's correct. But the assertion triggers when writing to address 3'h2. Wait, the control register is at address 0x02, which is 3'h2 in Verilog if the address bus is 3 bits. That's correct. But the property uses a logical AND with the mask and checks for zero. That's right because reserved bits must be written as zero.

The command register assertion uses mask 8'hE8, which covers bits 7:5 and bit 3. The spec says command register bits 7:5 and 3 are reserved. Correct. The address is 3'h4, which is 0x04, matching the command register's address. Good.

But wait, the command register is write-only, and the spec mentions that STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK bits are auto-cleared. However, the assertion here is about writes to the command register, ensuring reserved bits are zero. That's correct because the user should not write to reserved bits.

What about other registers? The Prescale and Transmit registers allow any value, so no assertions are needed, which is handled as mentioned. But the problem states not to create new signal names, so that's okay.

Clock cycle misinterpretations: The connectivity assertion uses posedge wb_clk_i, which is correct. But does the WISHBONE protocol require data stability until ack is received, even across multiple cycles? The property uses 'throughout', which should cover that. However, in WISHBONE, the data must be held stable until ack is received, which could be multiple cycles. The assertion should check that wb_dat_i remains stable from the start of the transaction (when stb and cyc are high) until ack is received. The current property uses 'throughout' with a sequence starting at the same cycle as the write, which might not capture multi-cycle delays before ack. Maybe using 'until_with' would be better.

Nested conditions: The properties have conditions like (wb_adr_i == ... && wb_we_i && ...). These are necessary and not overly nested. However, using a sequence to define a valid write transaction might improve readability. For example, defining a sequence for write_cycle and reusing it.

Completeness: Are there other registers with reserved bits? The status register is read-only, so writes are irrelevant. The receive register is read-only. The prescale and transmit registers have no reserved bits. So the assertions for control and command registers cover all reserved bits. That seems complete.

What about X or Z values? The spec doesn't mention, but in practice, writing X/Z to registers could cause issues. The current assertions don't check for valid known values. Adding a check that wb_dat_i is not unknown during write transactions might be needed, but the spec doesn't specify this, so maybe it's beyond the scope.

Another thing: The reset condition. The spec has both synchronous (wb_rst_i) and asynchronous (arst_i) resets. The disable iff uses (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i). If ARST_LVL is 0 (active low), then arst_i being 0 would trigger the reset. The condition arst_i != ARST_LVL becomes arst_i != 0, meaning arst_i is 1, which is not the active state. Wait, no: if ARST_LVL is 0 (active low), then the reset is active when arst_i is 0. So the disable condition should be (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i). The current condition uses !=, which would disable the assertion when arst_i is not in its active level. That's incorrect. For example, if ARST_LVL is 0, the assertion should be disabled when arst_i is 0 (active), but the current code disables when arst_i != 0, which is the opposite. This is a critical flaw.

Also, the spec mentions that arst_i and wb_rst_i are separate, and either can be used. The assertions should account for both resets being active. The current disable condition is incorrect for arst_i.

Another point: The stability property uses 'wb_ack_o' as the endpoint. However, in WISHBONE, once stb is asserted, it must stay asserted until ack is received. The data must remain stable until ack is received, which could be in the same cycle or later. The property as written should capture this, but perhaps using 'until' with wb_ack_o would be clearer.

In the functionality assertions, when writing to the control or command registers, the reserved bits must be zero. The assertions correctly check that, using bitmasks. That's correct.

Possible missing assertions: When writing to other registers (prescale, transmit), the data can be any value, so no checks needed. The answer mentions this, which is correct.

What about the command register's IACK bit? The spec says writing IACK clears interrupts. But the assertion here is about reserved bits, not the functionality of IACK. So it's out of scope for these SVAs.

Clock cycle misinterpretations: The properties use posedge clk, which aligns with WISHBONE's synchronous nature. Correct.

Nested conditions: The conditions in the properties are straightforward, no excessive nesting.

Completeness: Covers reserved bits for control and command registers, data stability, and width. Misses checking for X/Z on wb_dat_i during writes, but spec doesn't require it. Also, the reset condition is flawed.

Score: The reset condition error is critical (-50). The assert_final for width is incorrect (-20). The connectivity assertion's sequence might not handle multi-cycle ack properly (-10). Total score around 20/100.
</think>

**Critical Feedback & Score: 20/100**  

### **1. Reset Condition Flaw (Severe: -50)**  
- **Issue**: Incorrect disable condition for asynchronous reset.  
  - **Spec**: `arst_i` is active at level `ARST_LVL` (0 or 1).  
  - **Flaw**: `disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL ...)` disables assertions during *inactive* reset states.  
  - **Fix**: Use `disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)`.  

### **2. Width Assertion Misuse (Major: -20)**  
- **Issue**: `assert_final` is inappropriate for static width checks.  
  - **Spec**: `wb_dat_i` is defined as 8-bit in RTL.  
  - **Flaw**: `assert_final` checks at simulation end, not design time.  
  - **Fix**: Replace with compile-time `if ($bits(wb_dat_i) != 8) $error(...);`.  

### **3. Stability Assertion Gaps (Moderate: -10)**  
- **Issue**: Fails to handle multi-cycle transactions before `wb_ack_o`.  
  - **Spec**: Data must remain stable until `wb_ack_o` is received (could span cycles).  
  - **Flaw**: `1'b1 [*1:$] ##0 wb_ack_o` is ambiguous; `throughout` may not cover all cases.  
  - **Fix**: Use `until_with`:  
    ```systemverilog
    (wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> ##[1:$] $stable(wb_dat_i) until_with wb_ack_o;
    ```  

### **4. X/Z Checks Omitted (Minor: -10)**  
- **Issue**: No checks for unknown values during writes.  
  - **Spec**: Reserved bits must be 0, but invalid states (X/Z) are not prohibited.  
  - **Flaw**: Silent corruption if `wb_dat_i` has X/Z during writes.  
  - **Fix**: Add:  
    ```systemverilog
    assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) !$isunknown(wb_dat_i) iff (wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));
    ```  

### **5. Readability & Protocol Compliance (Minor: -10)**  
- **Issue**: No helper sequences for WISHBONE transactions.  
  - **Flaw**: Repeated conditions like `wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i` clutter code.  
  - **Fix**: Define a sequence:  
    ```systemverilog
    sequence wb_write; wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i; endsequence  
    ```  

### **6. Edge Cases Unaddressed (Minor: -10)**  
- **Issue**: No check for simultaneous writes to read-only registers (e.g., Status).  
  - **Spec**: Status register is read-only.  
  - **Flaw**: Writes to read-only registers are ignored but not flagged.  
  - **Fix**: Add assertion (if scope allows):  
    ```systemverilog
    assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (wb_adr_i == 3'h4 && wb_write) |-> !wb_we_i);
    ```

**Conclusion**:  
The SVAs address core functionality but have critical reset handling and width-check flaws. Correcting these and adding X/Z checks would significantly improve robustness. The current assertions are **incomplete and inconsistent** with the spec’s reset and protocol requirements.
