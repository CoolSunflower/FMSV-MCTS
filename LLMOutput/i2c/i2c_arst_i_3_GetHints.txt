It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the arst_i signal based on the provided specification. Let\'s start by understanding the role of arst_i.\n\nFirst, arst_i is an asynchronous reset. The spec says it\'s active either high or low, depending on the parameter ARST_LVL. The default is 1’b0, meaning active low if ARST_LVL is 0. Wait, no—the parameter ARST_LVL\'s default is 1’b0, but the description says it sets the asynchronous reset level. So if ARST_LVL is 0, then arst_i is active low, and if it\'s 1, active high.\n\nThe key points for arst_i are:\n1. It\'s asynchronous, so it doesn\'t depend on the clock.\n2. When asserted, it should reset the core\'s internal registers and logic.\n3. It should not be used simultaneously with wb_rst_i; they are alternatives.\n\nNow, thinking about possible assertions:\n\nFor width: arst_i is 1-bit, so check its width using $bits. But since it\'s a single bit, maybe that\'s redundant, but the user wants it. So an assertion like checking that the width is 1.\n\nConnectivity: Since arst_i is an asynchronous reset, when it\'s asserted, certain signals should be in their reset state. For example, the control register (ctr) should have EN bit cleared, prescale register (prer) should be at default 0xFFFF, etc. But the problem is that the user said not to create new signals. So maybe check that when arst_i is active, the core\'s outputs like wb_ack_o, wb_inta_o, or other registers are in reset state.\n\nBut the spec mentions that arst_i and wb_rst_i are alternatives. So maybe check that when arst_i is asserted, the core resets regardless of the clock. Also, ensure that when arst_i is not asserted, the reset state isn\'t active.\n\nFunction: The main function here is that arst_i asynchronously resets the core. So assertions should check that upon assertion of arst_i, the core\'s internal state is reset. For example, the status register (sr) should have certain bits like Busy, AL, TIP, IF cleared. The control register\'s EN bit should be 0. Also, the output signals like scl_pad_oe and sda_pad_oe should be in their inactive state (probably high, since they are output enables and active low? Wait, the spec says scl_padoen_o and sda_padoen_o are output enables. For example, when the core is reset, it should not drive the SCL or SDA lines, so the output enables should be high (since they are active low enables? Wait, looking at the Verilog code example: when scl_padoen_oe is 1, scl is high-Z. So the output enable is active low. So during reset, the output enables should be 1, meaning the core isn\'t driving the lines.\n\nSo possible assertions:\n\n1. When arst_i is asserted (according to ARST_LVL), the output enables (scl_padoen_o and sda_padoen_o) should be high (1), so the core isn\'t driving the bus.\n2. The control register\'s EN bit (ctr[7]) should be 0.\n3. The status register\'s Busy bit (sr[5]) should be 0, indicating the bus isn\'t busy.\n4. The command register (cr) should be 0, since it\'s a write-only register and reset value is 0x00.\n5. The prescale register (prer) should be at its reset value 0xFFFF.\n\nBut how to check these in SVAs? Since arst_i is asynchronous, the assertions need to check that whenever arst_i is active, these signals are in their reset state, regardless of the clock.\n\nBut SVAs are clock-based. Asynchronous assertions can be tricky. However, using immediate assertions might be an option, but they are not recommended for synthesis. Alternatively, check that upon the assertion of arst_i, at the next clock edge (if any), the signals are in reset. But since it\'s asynchronous, the reset should take effect immediately, not just at the clock edge.\n\nWait, but in Verilog, the actual implementation would have the asynchronous reset affecting the registers as soon as it\'s asserted, without waiting for a clock edge. However, SVAs are evaluated at clock edges. So to model this, perhaps check that at any time arst_i is active, the signals are in their reset state. But how to write that in SVA?\n\nAlternatively, use a checker that whenever arst_i is active, certain signals are in their reset state. But since SVAs are clocked, maybe use a combination of checking the reset condition and the signals.\n\nWait, the user specified to use posedge of a clock. But arst_i is asynchronous. Maybe the assertions should check that when arst_i is asserted, the reset state is achieved, regardless of the clock. But in SVA, the properties are evaluated at clock edges. So perhaps the approach is to check that whenever arst_i is active, the next clock edge sees the reset values.\n\nAlternatively, use an immediate assertion that checks whenever arst_i changes, but that\'s not synthesizable. Since the user wants SVAs for verification, maybe the best approach is to check that when arst_i is asserted, the next posedge of wb_clk_i (if any) will have the core in reset state.\n\nBut the core\'s registers should reset asynchronously. So when arst_i is active, regardless of the clock, the registers should be in reset. However, in simulation, the registers would update immediately upon arst_i assertion. But in SVA, since it\'s clock-based, the assertion would check at each clock edge whether arst_i is active and the signals are in reset.\n\nAlternatively, use a sequence that checks that whenever arst_i is active, the signals are in their reset state. But how to model that in SVA.\n\nAnother approach: For each register or output that should reset when arst_i is active, write an assertion that whenever arst_i is asserted, the signal is in the reset state. Since arst_i is asynchronous, the assertion should not depend on a clock edge. But SVA requires a clock for the property.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Because in SystemVerilog, the properties are evaluated at the clock edge. So to check asynchronous behavior, perhaps the best way is to check that whenever arst_i is active, the signals are in their reset state at every clock edge.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf arst_i is active (according to ARST_LVL), then at every posedge of wb_clk_i, the control register\'s EN bit is 0.\n\nBut this might not capture the asynchronous nature, because the reset could have occurred between clock edges. However, in simulation, the registers would update immediately, so at the next clock edge, they would already be in reset.\n\nAlternatively, the assertion could state that whenever arst_i is active, the signals are in reset, regardless of the clock. But SVA can\'t do that without a clock. So the user might have to use the clock, even if it\'s not perfect.\n\nSo possible assertions:\n\n1. Check that when arst_i is asserted, the control register\'s EN bit is 0. Since the reset is asynchronous, this should be true at any clock edge where arst_i is active.\n\nproperty arst_asserts_en_low;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL) |-> (ctr[7] == 1\'b0);\nendproperty\nassert property (arst_asserts_en_low);\n\nBut wait, the parameter ARST_LVL determines the active level. So if ARST_LVL is 0, arst_i is active low. So the condition should be (arst_i == ARST_LVL). For example, if ARST_LVL is 0, then when arst_i is 0 (active), the EN bit should be 0.\n\nSimilarly for other registers:\n\n2. Prescale register (prer) should be 16\'hFFFF when arst_i is active.\n\nproperty arst_prer_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL) |-> (prer == 16\'hFFFF);\nendproperty\nassert property (arst_prer_reset);\n\n3. Command register (cr) should be 8\'h00 when arst_i is active.\n\nBut cr is a write-only register. Its value might not be directly readable. Wait, in the spec, the command register\'s bits like STA, STO, etc., are automatically cleared after being set. But on reset, the cr should be 0x00.\n\nBut if cr is write-only, maybe we can\'t read it. Hmm, perhaps the spec says that the status register (sr) has certain bits that are affected by reset. For example, the Busy bit (sr[5]) should be 0 when reset is active.\n\nSo maybe check that when arst_i is active, sr[5] (Busy) is 0.\n\nproperty arst_busy_low;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL) |-> (sr[5] == 1\'b0);\nendproperty\nassert property (arst_busy_low);\n\nSimilarly, check that the output enables (scl_padoen_o and sda_padoen_o) are 1 when arst_i is active, meaning the core is not driving the bus.\n\nproperty arst_scl_oe_high;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL) |-> (scl_padoen_o == 1\'b1);\nendproperty\nassert property (arst_scl_oe_high);\n\nSame for sda_padoen_o.\n\nAlso, check that the interrupt output wb_inta_o is 0 when arst_i is active.\n\nproperty arst_inta_low;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL) |-> (wb_inta_o == 1\'b0);\nendproperty\nassert property (arst_inta_low);\n\nAdditionally, check that when arst_i is not active, the reset condition is not forcing these signals. But that might be more complex. However, the user asked for assertions for arst_i, so focus on when it\'s active.\n\nAnother point: The spec says that arst_i and wb_rst_i are alternatives. So maybe an assertion that they are not active at the same time. But the user said not to create new signals, but this is about existing signals.\n\nBut the user\'s instruction says: "Do not generate any new signals. Do NOT make any new information that is not provided." So maybe we can\'t check the interaction between arst_i and wb_rst_i unless it\'s in the spec. The spec says to use either arst_i or wb_rst_i, but the user might not want us to assume that. However, the spec mentions that they are alternatives, so perhaps an assertion that when arst_i is active, wb_rst_i is inactive, and vice versa. But the user might not have provided that in the signal list. Wait, the signal list includes both arst_i and wb_rst_i. So maybe an assertion that they are mutually exclusive.\n\nBut the user\'s instruction says to generate SVAs for arst_i, so maybe include that.\n\nBut the problem is that the user\'s provided signal list includes both arst_i and wb_rst_i. The spec says that only one should be used. So an assertion that they are not both active at the same time.\n\nproperty arst_wb_rst_mutex;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) !(arst_i == ARST_LVL && wb_rst_i == 1\'b1);\nendproperty\nassert property (arst_wb_rst_mutex);\n\nBut this is a mutual exclusion assertion. However, the spec says that the user should tie the unused reset to its inactive state. So in the design, they should not be active simultaneously. So this assertion checks that they are never active together.\n\nBut the user\'s question is to generate SVAs for arst_i, so this is relevant.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n- Check the width of arst_i is 1 bit.\n- Check that when arst_i is active, certain registers and outputs are in their reset state.\n- Check mutual exclusion between arst_i and wb_rst_i.\n\nBut the width check is straightforward:\n\nassert property ($bits(arst_i) == 1);\n\nBut in SystemVerilog, $bits is a function that can be used in an assertion. However, this is a static check, not a dynamic assertion. So maybe a compile-time check, but as an SVA, it\'s possible.\n\nBut the user might expect a simple assertion for width.\n\nNow, considering all these points, the SVAs for arst_i would include:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. When arst_i is active, control register\'s EN bit is 0.\n3. When arst_i is active, prescale register is 0xFFFF.\n4. When arst_i is active, status register\'s Busy, AL, TIP, IF bits are 0.\n5. Output enables (scl_padoen_o, sda_padoen_o) are 1.\n6. Interrupt output (wb_inta_o) is 0.\n7. arst_i and wb_rst_i are mutually exclusive.\n\nBut need to verify which of these are possible based on the provided signal list and spec.\n\nThe provided signal list includes:\n\n[ctr]: Control register\n[sr]: Status register\n[prer]: Prescale register\n[txr]: Transmit register\n[rxr]: Receive register\n[cr]: Command register\n\nSo we can refer to these registers.\n\nBut the spec says that the prescale register\'s reset value is 0xFFFF. So when arst_i is active, prer should be 0xFFFF.\n\nSimilarly, the control register\'s reset value is 0x00, so EN bit (ctr[7]) is 0.\n\nStatus register\'s reset value is 0x00, so all bits (RxACK, Busy, AL, TIP, IF) are 0.\n\nThe command register\'s reset value is 0x00.\n\nBut the command register is write-only, so maybe we can\'t read it. However, the spec says that the status register can be read, so the Busy bit (sr[5]) should be 0 on reset.\n\nSo assertions for when arst_i is active:\n\n- ctr[7] == 0 (EN bit disabled)\n- prer == 16\'hFFFF\n- sr[5] == 0 (Busy bit 0)\n- sr[4] == 0 (AL bit 0)\n- sr[3] == 0 (TIP bit 0)\n- sr[0] == 0 (IF bit 0)\n- scl_padoen_o == 1 (not driving SCL)\n- sda_padoen_o == 1 (not driving SDA)\n- wb_inta_o == 0 (interrupt not asserted)\n\nAlso, mutual exclusion with wb_rst_i.\n\nNow, writing these as SVAs:\n\nFor width:\n\n// Width check for arst_i\nassert property ($bits(arst_i) == 1);\n\nBut this is a compile-time check. However, in SVA, this can be written as an immediate assertion, but it\'s static. Alternatively, use a check that at all times, the width is 1. But since it\'s a 1-bit input, this might be redundant, but the user requested it.\n\nFor connectivity and function:\n\n// When arst_i is active, control register\'s EN bit is 0\nproperty arst_ctr_en;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL) |-> (ctr[7] == 1\'b0);\nendproperty\nassert property (arst_ctr_en);\n\n// Prescale register reset to 0xFFFF when arst_i is active\nproperty arst_prer_reset;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL) |-> (prer == 16\'hFFFF);\nendproperty\nassert property (arst_prer_reset);\n\n// Status register bits are 0 when arst_i is active\nproperty arst_sr_bits;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL) |-> (sr[5:0] == 6\'b000000);\nendproperty\nassert property (arst_sr_bits);\n\n// Output enables are high (core not driving SCL/SDA)\nproperty arst_scl_oe;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL) |-> (scl_padoen_o == 1\'b1);\nendproperty\nassert property (arst_scl_oe);\n\nproperty arst_sda_oe;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL) |-> (sda_padoen_o == 1\'b1);\nendproperty\nassert property (arst_sda_oe);\n\n// Interrupt output is low\nproperty arst_inta;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL) |-> (wb_inta_o == 1\'b0);\nendproperty\nassert property (arst_inta);\n\n// Mutual exclusion between arst_i and wb_rst_i\nproperty arst_wb_rst_mutex;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) !((arst_i == ARST_LVL) && (wb_rst_i == 1\'b1));\nendproperty\nassert property (arst_wb_rst_mutex);\n\nBut wait, the mutual exclusion assertion checks that both resets are not active at the same time. However, the spec says that only one should be used. So this assertion ensures they are not both active.\n\nBut the user\'s instruction says not to create new signals, so using existing signals is okay.\n\nNow, check if all these assertions are possible given the signal list.\n\nYes, all signals (arst_i, wb_rst_i, ctr, prer, sr, scl_padoen_o, sda_padoen_o, wb_inta_o) are provided.\n\nBut need to make sure that the reset value of the prescale register is 0xFFFF as per the spec.\n\nAlso, the status register\'s reset value is 0x00, so all bits are 0.\n\nThus, these assertions should cover the necessary checks for arst_i.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\nThe arst_i signal is an asynchronous reset that initializes the core\'s registers and outputs. Key assertions include checking its width, ensuring reset values in registers when active, verifying output enables are inactive, and mutual exclusivity with wb_rst_i. Each assertion targets specific aspects of the reset functionality as per the specification.\n\n[Verification]\nGenerated SVAs validate:\n1. Correct signal width.\n2.

The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `arst_i` signal based on the provided specification and feedback. First, I need to address the syntax errors reported. The previous answer used `scl_padoen_oe` and `sda_padoen_oe`, but the Jasper tool reported these signals as undeclared. Looking back at the specification, the correct signal names are `scl_padoen_o` and `sda_padoen_o`. The suffix "_oe" was a mistake, so I\'ll correct those to match the spec.\n\nNext, the feedback mentioned missing checks for the Command Register (`cr`). The spec states that `cr` bits (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK) should reset to 0.

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, let's go through the provided SVAs for the arst_i signal step by step. 

First, the width check is correct, ensuring arst_i is 1-bit. Good.

The mutual exclusivity check between arst_i and wb_rst_i uses assert final, which is appropriate for checking at all times. However, the spec says they should be mutually exclusive, but the assertion is !(arst_i && wb_rst_i). Wait, the spec mentions using either arst_i or wb_rst_i, but doesn't explicitly forbid both being active. However, in practice, they shouldn't be active simultaneously. The assertion is correct here.

Looking at the Control Register (ctr) reset: The assertion checks ctr == 8'h00. The spec says ctr has EN (bit 7) and IEN (bit 6), with reserved bits. On reset, EN and IEN should be 0, and reserved bits should read as 0. So the assertion is correct but could explicitly check reserved bits if they exist. However, since the spec says reserved bits are read as 0, the assertion is sufficient.

Prescale Register (prer) reset to 16'hFFFF: Correct as per spec.

Command Register (cr) reset: The assertion checks cr == 8'h00. The spec states that STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK bits are auto-cleared and always read as 0. The reserved bits should be 0. So this is correct.

Transmit (txr) and Receive (rxr) registers reset to 0: Correct.

Status Register (sr) reset: The assertion checks sr == 8'h00. The status register has RxACK (bit 7), Busy (bit 5), AL (bit 4), TIP (bit 3), IF (bit 0), with bits 6, 2, 1 as reserved. On reset, all should be 0. The assertion is correct.

Tri-state controls (scl_padoen_o and sda_padoen_o) are set to 1 during reset, which disables the outputs. Correct.

SCL and SDA outputs default to 1 during reset: The spec's external connections show that SCL and SDA should be released (high) when output enable is inactive. The assertions check scl_pad_o and sda_pad_o are 1, which matches the spec's tri-state implementation. Correct.

Interrupt output (wb_inta_o) deasserted: Correct.

Potential flaws:

1. **Asynchronous Reset Timing**: The properties use @(posedge wb_clk_i), but arst_i is asynchronous. This might miss transitions between clock edges. For example, if arst_i asserts between clock edges, the SVAs using posedge wb_clk_i might not capture the immediate effect. However, since the registers are reset asynchronously, the SVAs check the result at the next clock edge, which is acceptable but might not cover all scenarios.

2. **Immediate Assertions for Asynchronous Effects**: The reset's impact on combinational signals (like scl_padoen_o) should be checked immediately upon arst_i assertion, not just at clock edges. Using posedge wb_clk_i could miss transitions when the clock isn't toggling. For example, if arst_i asserts when the clock is stopped, the SVAs wouldn't trigger. However, in practice, the clock is usually running, but this is a coverage gap.

3. **Reserved Bits in Registers**: The assertions assume all reserved bits are 0, which is correct per spec. No issue here.

4. **Missing Check for Arbitration Lost (AL) Behavior**: The spec mentions that arst_i can be used to reset the core if it hangs due to arbitration loss. However, there's no SVA checking that AL (sr[4]) is cleared upon arst_i. The current assertion checks the entire sr register, so it's covered, but an explicit check could add clarity.

5. **Clock Generator Prescale Reset**: The prescale register is reset, but the internal clock generator's state isn't directly checked. However, resetting prer to 16'hFFFF should suffice as the clock generator uses this value.

6. **No Check for Simultaneous Reset and Operation**: There's no SVA to ensure that when arst_i is active, no transfers are in progress (TIP == 0). The spec mentions that arst_i should be used when the core is disabled, but this isn't enforced here.

7. **Tri-state Outputs During Reset**: The assertions check that scl_padoen_o and sda_padoen_o are 1 (output disabled), but in the tri-state buffer implementation, the actual SCL and SDA lines should be high-Z. The SVAs check the output enable signals but not the pad outputs' behavior in the system. However, the spec's Verilog code shows that the pads are set to Z when output enable is high, so the SVAs are sufficient.

8. **Missing Check for Asynchronous Reset Level (ARST_LVL)**: The parameter ARST_LVL defines whether arst_i is active high or low. The SVAs use (arst_i == ARST_LVL), which is correct. However, if ARST_LVL is not properly set (e.g., 1'b1 instead of 1'b0), the assertions would fail. This is a configuration issue, not an SVA flaw.

9. **No Check for Register Write During Reset**: The spec says that registers should not be written when the core is disabled (EN=0). However, during arst_i, the core is in reset, so writes should be ignored. There's no SVA to check that writes to registers (e.g., txr, cr) during arst_i have no effect. This could be an oversight.

10. **Interrupt Flag (IF) Clear**: The assertion checks wb_inta_o is 0 during reset, which is correct. However, if an interrupt was pending before reset, the SVA ensures it's cleared, which aligns with the spec.

**Score Rationale**:
- **Correctness**: Most assertions correctly reflect the spec. Minor issues with asynchronous timing coverage. (-5)
- **Consistency**: All registers and outputs are checked consistently. (+0)
- **Completeness**: Missing checks for register writes during reset and immediate asynchronous effects. (-10)
- **Clock Cycle Misinterpretations**: Using posedge wb_clk_i for async reset effects might miss some cases. (-5)
- **Nested Conditions**: No complex conditions, so no issue. (+0)

**Total Score**: 80/100

**Feedback**:
1. **Asynchronous Timing**: Add immediate assertions using `$global_clock` or check signal states independent of wb_clk_i to capture reset effects at any time.
2. **Register Writes During Reset**: Add SVAs to ensure writes to control/command registers during arst_i are ignored.
3. **Explicit Arbitration Lost Clear**: Explicitly check sr[4] (AL) is cleared.
4. **TIP During Reset**: Verify TIP (sr[3]) is 0 during reset to ensure no ongoing transfers.
5. **Tri-state Pad Outputs**: Although output enables are checked, consider adding checks that SCL/SDA pads are high-Z when enables are inactive, if possible in the simulation environment.
