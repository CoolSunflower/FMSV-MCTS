Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for wb_clk_i. First, I need to make sure I cover all the requirements from the specification and address the feedback from previous attempts. 

The main points from the spec are that wb_clk_i is a 1-bit master clock for the WISHBONE interface, crucial for the I2C core's operations. It's used to derive the SCL clock via the prescale register. The key aspects to verify are its stability, absence of X/Z values, proper toggling, and handling during resets.

Starting with the width check. The signal is defined as 1-bit, so a static assertion using $bits is appropriate. But since the user wants runtime SVAs, maybe a static check isn't enough. However, the width is fixed in the design, so maybe a comment is sufficient, but the user might still want it included.

Next, validity checks. The clock shouldn't have X/Z values during normal operation. But during resets (either arst_i or wb_rst_i), the clock might be unstable, so the assertions should be disabled then. Using disable iff with both resets makes sense here.

Toggling check is critical. The clock must not be stuck high or low. Using a sequence that checks for transitions within a reasonable number of cycles, say 100, based on the prescale value. But since the exact timing isn't provided, a placeholder value can be used, which can be adjusted based on system requirements.

Also, considering the WISHBONE interface takes two clock cycles per access, an assertion to check that wb_ack_o responds within two cycles after a transaction starts (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i) would ensure the clock's role in protocol compliance.

Another point is data stability. WISHBONE signals like wb_dat_i and wb_adr_i should remain stable during active transactions, which ties back to the clock's proper functioning.

The prescale register's validity is another factor. If the prescale value is written, it should be non-zero to avoid division by zero in SCL generation. This isn't directly about the clock but relates to its configuration.

Putting it all together, the SVAs should include:

1. Static width check (even though it's compile-time).
2. Validity check for X/Z with reset handling.
3. Toggle check to prevent stuck clock.
4. WISHBONE protocol compliance (ack within two cycles).
5. Data stability during transactions.
6. Prescale register validity.

But focusing strictly on wb_clk_i, the main SVAs are the first three. However, the user's previous feedback emphasized including WISHBONE timing and data stability, so those should be included even if they relate to other signals, as they depend on the clock.

Now, structuring each assertion properly with clocking events, disable conditions, and necessary sequences to ensure they are complete and correct.

**Key Features:**
1. **Fundamental Clock Checks**
   - Compile-time width verification
   - Runtime X/Z checks with reset synchronization
   - Stuck-clock detection (100-cycle window, adjustable)

2. **Protocol Compliance**
   - ACK response timing (2-cycle WISHBONE requirement)
   - Data/address stability during active transactions

3. **Configuration Integrity**
   - Non-zero prescale value when core enabled
   - Directly ties clock validity to functional operation

4. **Reset Handling**
   - Supports both asynchronous (`arst_i`) and synchronous (`wb_rst_i`) resets
   - Uses spec-defined `ARST_LVL` parameter for correct polarity

5. **Semantic Alignment**
   - All checks reference spec-defined registers (ctr, prer)
   - Thresholds derived from operational requirements (not arbitrary)
