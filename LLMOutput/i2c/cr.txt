Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for the Command Register (cr) step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand all the specifications and requirements.

The cr is an 8-bit write-only register at address 0x04. The bits have specific functions:
- Bit 7 (STA): Start condition
- Bit 6 (STO): Stop condition
- Bit 5 (RD): Read operation
- Bit 4 (WR): Write operation
- Bit 3 (ACK): Acknowledge control
- Bit 0 (IACK): Interrupt acknowledge
Bits 2:1 are reserved and must be written as zeros. The command bits (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK) auto-clear after execution and read as zeros. The reset value is 0x00.

Now, considering the types of SVAs needed: width, connectivity, functionality, and reset checks.

1. **Width Check**: Ensure cr is 8 bits wide. This is straightforward using $bits.

2. **Reserved Bits**: Any write to cr must have bits 2:1 as 0. This needs an assertion during write operations.

3. **Auto-Clear of Command Bits**: After a write, STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK should clear. However, the exact timing isn't specified, but the spec says they auto-clear after execution. So, check they are 0 in the next cycle.

4. **Mutual Exclusivity**: The spec doesn't explicitly forbid STA/STO or RD/WR being set together, but typically, RD and WR shouldn't be active simultaneously. However, since the spec allows command processing, maybe only check RD/WR conflict.

5. **Interrupt Clear (IACK)**: Writing IACK should clear the interrupt flag (sr[0]). Need to check sr[0] is cleared after a write with IACK set.

6. **Reset Value**: After reset (async or sync), cr should be 0x00. Parameterize the async reset based on ARST_LVL.

7. **Reserved Bits Read**: Even though cr is write-only, if read, reserved bits should be 0. But since it's write-only, maybe this is handled by the WISHBONE interface. However, adding a read check for reserved bits ensures they aren't mistakenly used.

8. **ACK Functionality**: ACK bit (bit 3) should only affect read operations. Need to ensure that when a read is active (RD set), the ACK bit drives the SDA line correctly.

Now, structuring each assertion:

- **Width Check**: Simple assertion using $bits.
- **Reserved Bits on Write**: Check during write that bits 2:1 are 0.
- **Reserved Bits on Read**: If a read occurs, ensure bits 2:1 are 0 (though cr is write-only, this is a safety check).
- **Command Bits Auto-Clear**: After a write, check STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK are 0 in the next cycle.
- **RD/WR Conflict**: Ensure RD and WR aren't set together.
- **IACK Clears Interrupt**: After writing IACK, check sr[0] is 0 within 1-2 cycles.
- **Reset Checks**: Async and sync reset checks.
- **ACK Functionality**: Link ACK bit to SDA behavior during reads.

Potential issues from previous attempts included incorrect handling of ACK in auto-clear and missing reserved bits read check. Need to correct those.

Final SVAs should cover all these points without introducing new signals or assumptions beyond the spec.

[REASONING]
1. **Width Check**: Ensure `cr` is 8 bits.
2. **Reserved Bits**: Verify bits 2:1 are 0 on write and read.
3. **Auto-Clear**: Command bits (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK) must clear after a write.
4. **Mutual Exclusivity**: Prevent RD and WR from being set simultaneously.
5. **Interrupt Clear**: IACK write clears interrupt flag (sr[0]) within 1-2 cycles.
6. **Reset Handling**: Check reset values for both async and sync resets.
7. **ACK Functionality**: Ensure ACK bit drives SDA correctly during reads.
