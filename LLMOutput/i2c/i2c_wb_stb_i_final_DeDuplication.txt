Okay, let me tackle this step by step. The user is asking to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions related to the signal wb_stb_i from the provided list. They want to ensure maximum retention of assertions, including any width checks, and to present them without modifications.

First, I need to look through each assertion provided and determine if it pertains to wb_stb_i. Let's list them out:

1. **wb_stb_reset_inactive**: Checks that wb_stb_i is inactive during reset. It uses wb_stb_i in the consequent, so this is relevant.
2. **wb_stb_cyc_connectivity**: Asserts that wb_stb_i implies wb_cyc_i. Directly involves wb_stb_i.
3. **wb_stb_ack_response**: Ensures that after stb and cyc are high, ack comes in two cycles. Uses wb_stb_i in the antecedent.
4. **wb_input_stability**: Checks that the inputs remain stable until ack. Mentions wb_stb_i in the antecedent.
5. **wb_stb_retention**: Verifies that wb_stb_i stays high until ack. Directly about wb_stb_i.
6. **wb_stb_width**: Confirms that the width of wb_stb_i is 1 bit. Exactly the width check the user emphasized.

Now, check for uniqueness. All these properties have different purposes, so they are unique. Each addresses a different aspect of wb_stb_i's behavior: reset conditions, connectivity with cyc, timing of ack, input stability, retention during transaction, and signal width. None of them are duplicates.

Next, ensure validity. All assertions are correctly formatted in SystemVerilog. They use appropriate operators and constructs. For example, the use of |-> for implication, disable iff for resets, and $stable for input stability.

The user also mentioned that the width assertion must be present. In the list provided, there's an assertion checking the bit width of wb_stb_i, which is included. So that's covered.

No modifications are needed since the user insists on not changing the assertions. Just need to list them as they are, making sure all relevant ones are included.

So the final list includes all six assertions because each directly involves wb_stb_i and addresses different properties. They are all unique and valid, and the width check is present. Therefore, the answer should include all the provided assertions related to wb_stb_i.
