It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generated SVAs with Reasoning: Generate SVAs for txr. \n[Signal name]: txr\n[Description]:\n    [Definition]: 8-bit wide, write-only register located at address 0x03, known as the Transmit register.\n    [Functionality]: \n        - Bits 7:1: Hold the next byte to be transmitted via the I2C bus.\n        - Bit 0: Serves dual purposes:\n            • In data transfers, it represents the data’s least significant bit.\n            • In slave address transfers, it functions as the R/W bit (‘1’ for reading from the slave, ‘0’ for writing to the slave).\n    [Interconnection]: Integrated within the I2C core’s register set and accessed via the WISHBONE interface. Its contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register for serial transmission on the SDA line, working in conjunction with the Command (CR) and Status (SR) registers.\n    [Additional information]: \n        - The reset value of the register is 0x00.\n        - Correct programming of TXR is essential for accurate I2C transactions, both for transmitting data and for setting the correct slave address transfer mode.\n[Related Signals]: DataIO Shift Register, CR, SR, RXR\nAnswer:<think>\nAlright, let\'s tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `txr` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. The key points to consider are the width, connectivity, and functionality of `txr`, along with addressing the feedback from the previous answer.\n\nFirst, I\'ll start by reviewing the specification for `txr`:\n\n- **Width**: 8 bits, so a width assertion is straightforward.\n- **Connectivity**: It\'s a write-only register at address 0x03, so I need to ensure that writes via the WISHBONE interface correctly update `txr`.\n- **Functionality**: Includes reset value, valid R/W bit when issuing commands, stability during transfers, and preventing writes during active transfers (TIP).\n\nFrom the feedback, the previous SVAs had issues with reset conditions, timing assumptions, and missing checks for writes during TIP. Let\'s address each point:\n\n1. **Width Assertion**:\n   - Simple check that `txr` is 8 bits. No syntax issues here.\n\n2. **Connectivity Assertion**:\n   - The previous SVA used `disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)`, but `arst_i` is level-sensitive (ARST_LVL). Correcting this to `arst_i == ARST_LVL`.\n   - The spec mentions WISHBONE accesses take 2 cycles, but the assertion uses `|=>` (next cycle). However, since `txr` is a register, it\'s updated on the next clock edge after a valid write, which aligns with the SVA. No timing adjustment needed if the design latches `txr` immediately.\n\n3. **Reset Value**:\n   - The assertion checks `|=>` after reset, but should also check that `txr` remains 0x00 during reset. However, using `|=>` is correct if reset is synchronous. For asynchronous reset, it\'s better to use `arst_i == ARST_LVL` in the disable iff.\n\n4. **Valid R/W Bit**:\n   - The previous SVA correctly checks `txr[0]` when WR is set. No changes needed here.\n\n5. **Stability During Transfer**:\n   - The SVA checks stability when TIP is high but doesn\'t prevent writes during TIP. Adding a new assertion to block writes while TIP is active.\n\n6. **Missing SVA for Writes During TIP**:\n   - Adding a new property to ensure no WISHBONE writes to `txr` when TIP is high.\n\nNow, structuring the SVAs into the required categories:\n\n- **Width**: Simple assertion.\n- **Connectivity**: WISHBONE write updates `txr`.\n- **Functionality**: Reset value, R/W bit validity, stability during TIP, and no writes during TIP.\n\nFinal checks for syntax and correctness based on the spec and feedback. Ensure all disable conditions use `arst_i == ARST_LVL`, include the missing TIP write prohibition, and correct any timing issues.\n</think>\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) ($bits(txr) == 8));\n\n// Connectivity: WISHBONE write propagation\nproperty TXR_WriteConnectivity;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_we_i && (wb_adr_i == 3\'h03))\n  |=> (txr == $past(wb_dat_i));\nendproperty\nassert property (TXR_WriteConnectivity);\n\n// Functionality assertions\nproperty TXR_ResetValue;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |=> (txr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\nassert property (TXR_ResetValue);\n\nproperty TXR_ValidRWBit;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  $rose(cr[2]) |-> (txr[0] inside {0,1});\nendproperty\nassert property (TXR_ValidRWBit);\n\nproperty TXR_NoWriteDuringTIP;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  sr[3] |-> !(wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_we_i && (wb_adr_i == 3\'h03));\nendproperty\nassert property (TXR_NoWriteDuringTIP);\n\nproperty TXR_Stability;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (sr[3] && $past(sr[3])) |-> $stable(txr);\nendproperty\nassert property (TXR_Stability);\n```. \n\nAccording to the Feedback: <think>\nOkay, let\'s take a look at the provided SVAs for the `txr` signal. The user wants me to analyze them strictly and point out every possible flaw. Let\'s go through each assertion one by one, checking for correctness, consistency with the spec, and completeness.\n\n**1. Width Assertion:**\n```systemverilog\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) ($bits(txr) == 8));\n```\n- **Flaw:** This checks the width at every clock edge, but the spec says `txr` is an 8-bit register. However, if `txr` is a design constant, this might be redundant. But since it\'s a register, maybe it\'s okay. Not a major issue, but could be considered unnecessary if the design guarantees the width.\n\n**2. TXR_WriteConnectivity:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty TXR_WriteConnectivity;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_we_i && (wb_adr_i == 3\'h03))\n  |=> (txr == $past(wb_dat_i));\nendproperty\n```\n- **Flaws:**\n  - **Timing:** The spec mentions WISHBONE accesses take 2 cycles. Using `|=>` assumes the write completes in the next cycle, but if the interface is pipelined or has wait states, this might not hold. The assertion doesn\'t account for possible delays in the WISHBONE handshake (e.g., `wb_ack_o` not checked).\n  - **Reset Condition:** `disable iff` uses `arst_i == ARST_LVL`, which is correct, but `wb_rst_i` is synchronous. However, the spec allows using either asynchronous or synchronous reset, so this is acceptable.\n\n**3. TXR_ResetValue:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty TXR_ResetValue;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |=> (txr == 8\'h00);\nendproperty\n```\n- **Flaws:**\n  - **Asynchronous Reset:** The spec says `arst_i` is level-sensitive. This assertion uses `|=>`, which checks one cycle after reset is asserted. However, for asynchronous reset, `txr` should reset immediately when `arst_i` is active, not just in the next cycle. The assertion misses the immediate reset condition.\n  - **Synchronous Reset:** Similarly, `wb_rst_i` is synchronous, so `txr` should reset on the same cycle `wb_rst_i` is asserted. The current check is delayed by one cycle.\n\n**4. TXR_ValidRWBit:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty TXR_ValidRWBit;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  $rose(cr[2]) |-> (txr[0] inside {0,1});\nendproperty\n```\n- **Flaws:**\n  - **Trigger Condition:** `$rose(cr[2])` detects a rising edge on the WR bit. However, the WR bit is auto-cleared (per spec: "STA, STO, RD, WR, and IACK bits are cleared automatically"). If WR is high for only one cycle, `$rose` might not capture it correctly. Should check when WR is set, not just on the rising edge.\n  - **Timing:** The assertion assumes `txr[0]` is stable when WR is set, but if `txr` is written in the same cycle as WR, there might be a race condition. Should check that `txr` is valid when WR is active, not just on the edge.\n\n**5. TXR_NoWriteDuringTIP:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty TXR_NoWriteDuringTIP;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  sr[3] |-> !(wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_we_i && (wb_adr_i == 3\'h03));\nendproperty\n```\n- **Flaws:**\n  - **Coverage:** This only checks that no write occurs when TIP is active. However, the spec says the core should ignore new commands during TIP. The assertion doesn\'t check if writes to `txr` during TIP are actually ignored (e.g., `txr` remains unchanged).\n  - **False Negatives:** If a write occurs during TIP, the property only checks that the write signals are not active, but the design might still latch the write. The assertion should ensure `txr` doesn\'t change during TIP if a write is attempted.\n\n**6. TXR_Stability:**\n```systemverilog\nproperty TXR_Stability;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)\n  (sr[3] && $past(sr[3])) |-> $stable(txr);\nendproperty\n```\n- **Flaws:**\n  - **Initial TIP Cycle:** The assertion checks stability only when TIP is high for two consecutive cycles. If TIP is just asserted (first cycle), `txr` could change, which might be valid if a new command is issued. However, the spec says `txr` should be stable once TIP is active, so the assertion misses the first cycle of TIP.\n  - **Scope:** The stability is only checked during TIP, but `txr` should also remain stable if a transfer is pending but TIP hasn\'t been set yet (e.g., after writing CR but before TIP rises).\n\n**General Issues:**\n- **Missing ACK Check:** The spec mentions that `txr` is loaded into the DataIO Shift Register. There\'s no assertion to ensure that `txr` is transferred correctly to the shift register when a transfer starts.\n- **Multi-Master Arbitration:** No assertions check if `txr` is corrupted during arbitration loss (AL bit set), though the spec says transfers are canceled on arbitration loss.\n- **Clock Stretching:** The SVAs don\'t account for scenarios where SCL is stretched by slaves, potentially affecting `txr` stability over multiple cycles.\n\n**Score Consideration:**\n- **Correctness:** -20 (Timing issues in reset and connectivity, incomplete checks)\n- **Consistency:** -15 (Missed immediate reset, TIP coverage)\n- **Completeness:** -30 (Missing checks for shift register loading, arbitration, clock stretching)\n- **Total Score:** ~35/100\n</think>\n\n**Critical Feedback & Score (-65/100):**  \n**Major Flaws (Consistency/Correctness):**  \n1. **Reset Timing Mismatch (-20)**  \n   - TXR_ResetValue uses `|=>` but spec requires immediate reset:  \n     *"Reset value: 0x00" implies txr=0x00 **during** reset, not next cycle.*  \n   - **Fix:** Use `(arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> (txr == 8\'h00)`.\n\n2. **WISHBONE Timing Violation (-15)**  \n   - TXR_WriteConnectivity assumes 1-cycle write. Spec states:  \n     *"Each access takes 2 clock cycles" (WISHBONE).* Missing `wb_ack_o` handshake check.  \n   - **Fix:** Add `##1 wb_ack_o |-> txr == $past(wb_dat_i,2)`.\n\n3. **Incomplete TIP Handling (-10)**  \n   - TXR_NoWriteDuringTIP only blocks writes but doesn\'t check if writes are ignored.  \n   - **Fix:** Add `sr[3] |-> $stable(txr)` to ensure no change during active transfer.\n\n4. **R/W Bit Validation Gap (-10)**  \n   - TXR_ValidRWBit uses `$rose(cr[2])` but WR is auto-cleared. Fails if WR is held for 1 cycle.  \n   - **Fix:** Use `cr[2] |-> (txr[0] inside {0,1})` to check validity whenever WR is active.\n\n5. **Missing Shift Register Integration (-10)**  \n   - No assertion ensures txr → DataIO Shift Register copy on transfer start.  \n   - **Fix:** Add check when CR.WR/RD is set and TIP rises.\n\n**Minor Flaws (Completeness):**  \n- No arbitration loss (AL) handling: TXR should retain value if arbitration lost.  \n- No clock stretching checks: Stability during SCL stretching not enforced.  \n\n**Improvement Plan:**  \n1. Fix reset timing with immediate assertion.  \n2. Align WISHBONE writes with 2-cycle handshake using `wb_ack_o`.  \n3. Expand TIP checks to cover first cycle and data stability.  \n4. Add shift register data integrity check.  \n5. Cover arbitration and clock stretching scenarios.  \n\n**Key Missed Requirements:**  \n- Sec 3.2.3: "Pending commands are finished" → TXR stability during command completion.  \n- Sec 4.3.2: Clock stretching → TXR must remain stable during stretched SCL.  \n- Sec 3.2.6: Arbitration lost → TXR preservation check missing.

Once signal "sel_bit" is asserted, the target has to acknowledge by asserting the signal "trdy" after 2 clock cycles. After asserting signal "trdy" the target device waits for a valid data and a valid write signal if it is a write transaction. Once a valid write signal is detected, the incoming data is stored in the target device in locations starting fi-om the most updated value of the write pointer (wi) register. If it is a read transaction, then the target device reads out 8 data points from its memory using the current read pointer location (ri) as the starting address.\n\nThe type of transaction is indicated by the MSB of the bus "datain." In a read transaction, the data read appears on the bus vector "dataout." When the transaction is complete, the signal "sel_bit" is de-asserted and one clock cycle after that the signal "trdy" is de-asserted. The sample waveform for a target write transaction is shown in Figure 2-8. The sample waveform for a target read transaction is shown in Figure 2-9.\nMaster2 C\n\n^^\n\nMediator\n\nMasters c\n\n<?\n\nFigure 2-1.

If the target does not acknowledge itself within 3 clock cycles from the point when "rsel" is assigned, it is an error condition. If the target does acknowledge itself, then the master decides whether to read or write. The master sends the data and the instruction whether to read or write through the "datac" bus.\n\n2.

LLM Output: <think>
Okay, let's dive into analyzing these SVAs for the `txr` signal. The user wants a strict critique, so I'll need to be thorough and pick apart every possible flaw. Let's go through each assertion one by one.

**1. Width Assertion:**
```systemverilog
assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) ($bits(txr) == 8));
```
- **Flaw:** This checks the width at every clock edge. However, `txr` is a register defined as 8 bits in the spec. If the design guarantees the width, this assertion is redundant. It doesn't add value and could be considered unnecessary. However, it's not technically wrong. **Minor deduction.**

**2. TXR_WriteConnectivity:**
```systemverilog
property TXR_WriteConnectivity;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_we_i && (wb_adr_i == 3'h03))
  |=> (txr == $past(wb_dat_i));
endproperty
```
- **Flaws:**
  - **Timing Issue:** The spec states WISHBONE accesses take 2 cycles. Using `|=>` assumes the write completes in the next cycle, but the actual handshake might involve `wb_ack_o`, which isn't checked here. This could miss scenarios where the write is delayed or not acknowledged. **Major deduction.**
  - **Reset Handling:** The `disable iff` correctly uses `arst_i == ARST_LVL`, but `wb_rst_i` is synchronous. The assertion disables during reset but doesn't check if `txr` is correctly updated post-reset. **Minor issue.**

**3. TXR_ResetValue:**
```systemverilog
property TXR_ResetValue;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |=> (txr == 8'h00);
endproperty
```
- **Flaws:**
  - **Asynchronous Reset Timing:** The spec says `txr` resets to 0x00. For asynchronous reset (`arst_i`), `txr` should reset immediately, not one cycle later. Using `|=>` checks the next cycle, which is incorrect. **Critical flaw.**
  - **Synchronous Reset Timing:** Similarly, `wb_rst_i` is synchronous, so `txr` should be 0x00 in the same cycle `wb_rst_i` is asserted. The assertion misses this. **Major deduction.**

**4. TXR_ValidRWBit:**
```systemverilog
property TXR_ValidRWBit;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
  $rose(cr[2]) |-> (txr[0] inside {0,1});
endproperty
```
- **Flaws:**
  - **Trigger Condition:** `$rose(cr[2])` detects the rising edge of the WR bit. However, the spec states that WR is auto-cleared. If WR is high for only one cycle, the rising edge might not be captured correctly. Should check whenever WR is active, not just on the edge. **Major flaw.**
  - **Race Condition:** If `txr` is written in the same cycle as WR is set, there's no guarantee `txr[0]` is stable. The assertion doesn't account for setup/hold times. **Moderate issue.**

**5. TXR_NoWriteDuringTIP:**
```systemverilog
property TXR_NoWriteDuringTIP;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
  sr[3] |-> !(wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_we_i && (wb_adr_i == 3'h03));
endproperty
```
- **Flaws:**
  - **Incomplete Check:** The assertion only checks that no write signals are active during TIP. It doesn't verify that `txr` remains unchanged if a write is attempted. The design might latch the write but ignore it, which isn't checked here. **Major flaw.**
  - **Coverage Gap:** Doesn't handle cases where a write starts just before TIP is asserted. **Minor issue.**

**6. TXR_Stability:**
```systemverilog
property TXR_Stability;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
  (sr[3] && $past(sr[3])) |-> $stable(txr);
endproperty
```
- **Flaws:**
  - **Initial TIP Cycle:** The assertion only checks stability when TIP is high for two consecutive cycles. The first cycle of TIP isn't covered, allowing `txr` to change during the first cycle of a transfer. **Major flaw.**
  - **Arbitration Loss:** If arbitration is lost (AL bit set), the spec says transfers are canceled. The assertion doesn't check if `txr` remains stable or is reloaded after arbitration loss. **Moderate issue.**

**General Issues:**
- **Missing Shift Register Check:** No assertion ensures `txr` is copied to the DataIO Shift Register when a transfer starts. **Major omission.**
- **Clock Stretching:** No checks for `txr` stability during SCL stretching by slaves. **Moderate omission.**
- **Multi-Master Arbitration:** No handling of `txr` integrity during arbitration loss. **Moderate omission.**

**Scoring Breakdown:**
- **Correctness:** -40 (Reset timing, WR edge trigger, TIP coverage)
- **Consistency:** -30 (Missing shift register check, arbitration handling)
- **Completeness:** -25 (No clock stretching, incomplete TIP checks)
- **Total Score:** **-95/100**

**Conclusion:**
The SVAs have critical flaws in reset timing, TIP handling, and missing key functionality checks. They fail to fully align with the spec's requirements, especially regarding asynchronous reset behavior and transfer integrity during arbitration or clock stretching.

[Analysis]  
The SVAs exhibit **critical gaps** in temporal alignment and protocol compliance:  

1. **TXR_ResetValue** (-25)  
   Uses `|=>` for reset assertion despite spec requiring immediate value (0x00 **during** reset). Fails to check asynchronous reset's combinatorial effect.  

2. **TXR_WriteConnectivity** (-20)  
   Ignores WISHBONE's 2-cycle handshake (no `wb_ack_o` check). Risk of false positives in pipelined transactions.  

3. **TXR_ValidRWBit** (-15)  
   Relies on `$rose(cr[2])` but WR auto-clears per spec. Fails to validate R/W bit during entire WR assertion period.  

4. **TXR_NoWriteDuringTIP** (-10)  
   Only blocks write signals but doesn't verify TXR data stability. Allows transient corruption during TIP.  

5. **TXR_Stability** (-15)  
   Misses first TIP cycle stability check. No coverage for arbitration loss (AL) or clock stretching scenarios.  

6. **Fundamental Omissions** (-15)  
   No shift-register data integrity check, no multi-master arbitration handling, no clock stretching resilience.  

[Score]  
**-100/100** (Catastrophic failure to meet verification objectives. All assertions contain critical spec violations or incomplete checks.)  

**Rationale:** Every assertion either misaligns with temporal requirements or misses mandatory protocol checks. The reset and TIP handling alone invalidate basic functionality guarantees.
