<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to correct the syntax of the provided SystemVerilog assertions related to the rxr signal in the I2C master core. The main issues from the Jasper logs are undeclared signals like DataIO_Shift_Reg and s_read_trigger. Also, there's a note about signal renames: sda_padoen_o to sda_pad_oe and similarly for scl. But since the focus is on rxr, maybe those renames aren't directly relevant here.

First, looking at the first assertion, p_rxr_read_update. The error was that DataIO_Shift_Reg isn't declared. From the documentation, the DataIO Shift Register is part of the core's internal structure. But in Verilog, unless this register is explicitly present in the design with that exact name, the assertion can't reference it directly. The user mentioned not to create new signals, so I need to find an alternative.

The Receive Register (rxr) gets its data from the DataIO Shift Register after a read. Instead of referencing DataIO_Shift_Reg, maybe the assertion can check that rxr is updated correctly when a read operation completes. The key is to trigger on the completion of a read transfer, which is indicated by the TIP bit (sr[3]) falling and the IF bit (sr[0]) rising. Also, the RD bit in the Command Register (cr[2]) being set in the previous cycle.

For the second assertion, p_rxr_valid_after_read, the error was s_read_trigger not being declared. The idea here is to check that after a read is triggered, rxr is valid (not X or Z). Instead of using a user-defined trigger, maybe use the setting of the RD bit in the Command Register as the starting point.

Also, the disable iff conditions need to be correct. The original used arst_i == ARST_LVL, but the spec says ARST_LVL is the level (0 or 1) for the asynchronous reset. So the disable should be when either synchronous reset (wb_rst_i) is active or asynchronous reset (arst_i) is at its active level. So disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i).

Another thing: in the first assertion, $past(cr[2]) checks if RD was set previously. Then, when TIP falls (sr[3] goes low) and IF rises (sr[0] goes high), rxr should have the data from the shift register. But since we can't access the shift register, maybe the assertion can't directly compare to it. Wait, but the documentation says that the Receive Register is updated after the transfer, so perhaps the exact value can't be checked without knowing the shift register's value. However, the user might want to ensure that when a read completes, rxr is updated. But without the shift register's value, maybe the assertion is about the timing, not the exact data. Hmm, maybe the first assertion is meant to check that rxr is updated with the correct data from the shift register when a read completes. But if the shift register isn't a signal in the design, this can't be done. Perhaps the original assertion was incorrect in referencing DataIO_Shift_Reg, and the correct approach is to remove that part, focusing instead on the fact that rxr is updated when the read completes.

Wait, looking back at the documentation, the Receive Register (rxr) is described as holding the last byte received. So when a read operation is done (TIP falls, IF rises), rxr should have the new data. The DataIO Shift Register is internal, so maybe the assertion can't directly reference it. Therefore, the first assertion might need to be adjusted to check that rxr changes when a read completes, but without comparing to the shift register. Alternatively, maybe the shift register is a signal in the design but with a different name. The user's error indicates that DataIO_Shift_Reg isn't declared, so perhaps in the actual RTL, it's named differently, like shift_reg or something. But the user says not to create new signals, so perhaps the original assertion is incorrect and needs to be modified to not reference that signal.

Alternatively, maybe the DataIO Shift Register is part of the module's internal signals but not exposed. Since the user can't modify the design, the assertion can't reference it. Therefore, the first assertion's consequent can't check rxr against the shift register. So maybe the original assertion's purpose was to ensure that rxr is updated with the data from the shift register when a read completes. Without access to the shift register, this assertion can't be written as is. Therefore, perhaps the assertion should be rephrased to check that rxr is not unknown when the read completes, which is what the second assertion does.

Wait, the second assertion's error was about s_read_trigger. The user's second assertion tried to use s_read_trigger, which isn't defined. So instead, the trigger should be based on the RD bit in the Command Register (cr[2]) being set. So the sequence starts when RD is set, then after the transfer completes (TIP falls, IF rises), check that rxr is valid.

Putting this together, the corrected assertions would:

1. For p_rxr_read_update: Check that when a read command (RD bit set) is issued and the transfer completes (IF rises, TIP falls), the Receive Register (rxr) is updated. But without the shift register, maybe this can't be directly verified. Alternatively, maybe the original intent was to check that rxr is updated, which would require capturing the expected value another way. However, given the constraints, perhaps this assertion is not feasible as is and needs to be adjusted to a different condition.

Wait, the user provided two assertions. Let me look at their original code:

First assertion:
property p_rxr_read_update;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
  // Check RD was set & transfer completed (IF=1, TIP=0)
  ($past(cr[2]) && $rose(sr[0]) && !sr[3]) |-> (rxr == $past(DataIO_Shift_Reg));
endproperty

The error is DataIO_Shift_Reg not declared. So the user's RTL doesn't have that signal. Therefore, this line can't be used. So the assertion can't compare rxr to DataIO_Shift_Reg. So perhaps the intended check is that rxr is updated when a read completes. But without knowing the expected value, maybe this assertion is not possible. Alternatively, maybe the DataIO_Shift_Reg is named differently in the RTL. The documentation mentions the DataIO Shift Register, but in the RTL code, perhaps it's a signal named shift_reg or something else. But the user hasn't provided the RTL code, so I can't know. Therefore, the user might have made a mistake in referencing the signal, and the correct approach is to remove that part of the assertion.

Alternatively, maybe the assertion is supposed to check that after a read command, the rxr is updated, but without referencing the internal shift register. In that case, the assertion could check that rxr is not equal to its previous value when a read completes. However, that's not necessarily correct because the data might be the same as before. So perhaps the original assertion is not feasible without the internal signal.

Given the user's constraints (cannot create new signals, only use those in the spec), the DataIO_Shift_Reg is not a port or register mentioned in the spec's register list. The registers listed are PRER, CTR, TXR, RXR, CR, SR. So DataIO_Shift_Reg is an internal signal not directly accessible. Therefore, the assertion cannot reference it. Therefore, the first assertion is invalid as written and needs to be adjusted.

So perhaps the correct approach is to remove the comparison to DataIO_Shift_Reg and instead ensure that when a read completes, rxr is updated (though we can't check the value). Alternatively, maybe the assertion is meant to check that the received data is properly acknowledged, but that's part of the status register.

Alternatively, the RxACK bit (sr[7]) should be 0 if the slave acknowledged. So maybe the assertion should check that if RxACK is 0, then rxr is valid. But the original assertion was about the data being correctly transferred.

Given the confusion, perhaps the user's main issue is syntax errors due to undefined signals. So the corrected assertions should avoid referencing undefined signals.

Looking at the second assertion:

property p_rxr_valid_after_read;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
  disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i != !ARST_LVL)
  s_read_trigger 
  ##1 
  ($fell(sr[3]) && $rose(sr[0])) // TIP falls & IF rises
  |->
  !$isunknown(rxr); // rxr contains valid data (non-X/Z)
endproperty

The error is s_read_trigger not declared. The user needs to define what triggers a read. A read is triggered when the RD bit in the Command Register (cr[2]) is set. So instead of s_read_trigger, the sequence should start when cr[2] is set.

Putting this together, the corrected assertions would:

For p_rxr_read_update, since DataIO_Shift_Reg is not available, perhaps the assertion is not possible as intended. Maybe the user intended to check that after a read command, the receive register is updated, but without the internal signal, this can't be done. Alternatively, maybe the assertion is supposed to check that when a read completes, the receive register is not X. That's what the second assertion does, but with corrections.

So focusing on the second assertion first:

Original code had s_read_trigger, which is undefined. Replace that with the condition that the RD bit is set in the Command Register. So the sequence starts when cr[2] is high. Then, after one cycle, check that TIP falls and IF rises. Then, check that rxr is not unknown.

Also, the disable condition: the original had arst_i != !ARST_LVL. But ARST_LVL is the active level (0 or 1). The disable should be when the reset is active. So if ARST_LVL is 0 (active low), then arst_i == 0 would mean reset is active. Wait, the spec says ARST_LVL is the asynchronous reset level. So if ARST_LVL is 0, then the reset is active low. So the disable condition should be when arst_i is at its active level (arst_i == ARST_LVL) or when wb_rst_i is active.

So the disable iff should be (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i).

In the user's second assertion, they had arst_i != !ARST_LVL, which seems incorrect. For example, if ARST_LVL is 0 (active low), then !ARST_LVL is 1. So arst_i != 1 would mean arst_i is 0, which is the active level. Wait, that's the same as arst_i == ARST_LVL. So the disable condition should be (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i).

So correcting the disable iff in both assertions.

Now, for the first assertion, since DataIO_Shift_Reg is not available, perhaps the assertion is not feasible. But maybe the user intended to check that when a read completes, the receive register is updated. However, without knowing the expected value, the best we can do is check that it's not X, which is what the second assertion does.

Alternatively, maybe the first assertion can be rephrased to check that after a read command, the receive register is updated when the transfer completes. But without the shift register, we can't compare the value. So perhaps the first assertion is not correct as is and should be removed or modified.

But the user provided both assertions, so I need to correct both.

For the first assertion:

Original line: rxr == $past(DataIO_Shift_Reg)

Since DataIO_Shift_Reg is not a signal in the design, this can't be used. Maybe the assertion is supposed to check that rxr is updated when a read completes. But how? The Receive Register is loaded from the DataIO Shift Register after a read. So when a read completes (TIP falls, IF rises), rxr should hold the data from the shift register. But since we can't access the shift register, perhaps this assertion can't be written as is. Therefore, the user might need to remove this assertion or find another way to express it.

Alternatively, maybe the DataIO Shift Register is the same as the Transmit Register (TXR), but that's not the case. The documentation says that during a write, the Transmit Register is copied to the DataIO Shift Register. During a read, the DataIO Shift Register is copied to the Receive Register. So the Receive Register should match the DataIO Shift Register after a read. But without access to the shift register, this can't be verified.

Therefore, perhaps the first assertion is not feasible and should be omitted, or the user needs to adjust it to not reference the internal signal. Since the user wants the syntax fixed, maybe the solution is to remove the comparison to DataIO_Shift_Reg and instead check that rxr is not X, similar to the second assertion.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and the DataIO Shift Register is named differently in the RTL. For example, maybe it's 'shift_reg' or 'dio_shift_reg'. But without knowing the actual RTL signal names, I can't correct that. The user's Jasper error says 'DataIO_Shift_Reg' is not declared, so the signal name in the RTL is different. Therefore, the assertion can't reference it, so the line (rxr == $past(DataIO_Shift_Reg)) is invalid.

Given that, perhaps the first assertion should be removed or modified to check a different condition. However, the user wants both assertions fixed. So maybe the first assertion's purpose is to check that after a read command, the receive register is updated with the correct data. Since we can't access the shift register, perhaps the assertion is not possible as is. Therefore, the user might need to remove that part of the assertion.

Alternatively, maybe the assertion is supposed to check that when a read completes, the receive register is updated, which would mean that rxr changes from its previous value. But that's not necessarily correct because the same data could be read again. So that's not a valid check.

Hmm. This is tricky. Given the constraints, perhaps the first assertion should be adjusted to check that when a read completes (TIP falls, IF rises), the receive register is not X. That's similar to the second assertion. Alternatively, the first assertion could be checking that the receive register is updated when a read is performed, but without the internal signal, it's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to check that after a read command (RD bit set), the receive register is updated once the transfer completes. The original assertion tried to check that rxr equals the shift register's past value. Since that's not possible, perhaps the corrected assertion should check that rxr is not X when the transfer completes, which is covered by the second assertion.

Given all this, perhaps the first assertion is not fixable without access to the internal shift register signal, and the user should focus on the second assertion. However, the user provided both, so I need to find a way to correct both.

Wait, looking back at the documentation's register descriptions:

- The Receive Register (rxr) is read-only and holds the last received byte.

- When a read operation is completed (TIP bit falls, IF bit rises), the Receive Register should have the data from the slave.

So the first assertion's intent is to ensure that after a read, the Receive Register contains the data that was shifted in. But without the shift register's value, the assertion can't compare. Therefore, perhaps the first assertion is not feasible as written and should be removed or rephrased.

Alternatively, maybe the shift register's value is captured into rxr at the end of the transfer, so rxr should be equal to the shift register's value at that time. But since the shift register isn't a signal in the design (as per the Jasper error), the assertion can't reference it. Therefore, the user might have to omit that part of the check.

In that case, the corrected first assertion could check that when a read completes, rxr is not X, similar to the second assertion. But that would be redundant. Alternatively, the first assertion could check that the RxACK bit is 0 (acknowledge received) implies rxr is valid. But that's a different check.

Alternatively, the first assertion could be checking that after a read command, the receive register is updated, which would require that rxr changes from its previous value. But that's not necessarily correct, as the same data could be read again.

Given the constraints, perhaps the best approach is to correct the syntax errors in the assertions by removing references to undefined signals and adjusting the conditions based on the available signals from the specification.

So for the first assertion:

Original line:
($past(cr[2]) && $rose(sr[0]) && !sr[3]) |-> (rxr == $past(DataIO_Shift_Reg));

Remove the comparison to DataIO_Shift_Reg and instead check that rxr is not X. Or, since the data is supposed to be valid, check that it's stable. But the exact intent is unclear. Alternatively, if the user's goal is to ensure that rxr is updated when a read completes, perhaps the assertion can check that rxr is not equal to its previous value when a read completes. But that's not necessarily correct. However, given the lack of internal signals, maybe the assertion should be adjusted to check that rxr is not X when the read completes.

So the corrected first assertion could be:

property p_rxr_read_update;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
  ($past(cr[2]) && $rose(sr[0]) && !sr[3]) |-> !$isunknown(rxr);
endproperty

This checks that after a read command (RD bit was set), when the transfer completes (IF rises, TIP is low), rxr is not X or Z.

The second assertion, after correcting the trigger:

property p_rxr_valid_after_read;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
  disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
  (cr[2]) // When RD bit is set
  ##1 
  ($fell(sr[3]) && $rose(sr[0])) // TIP falls & IF rises
  |->
  !$isunknown(rxr);
endproperty

But wait, the ##1 means one cycle after cr[2] is set. However, the read operation might take multiple cycles. The sequence should wait until the TIP falls and IF rises, which indicates completion. So perhaps the sequence should be:

(cr[2] && !sr[3] && !sr[0]) // When RD is set and transfer not in progress and no interrupt pending
##1 (sr[3] throughout $rose(sr[0])) // Wait until TIP falls and IF rises
But that's more complex. Alternatively, use a sequence that matches the completion of the transfer after the RD bit is set.

Alternatively, the trigger is the setting of the RD bit, and then the property checks that eventually, when the transfer completes, rxr is valid.

But in SystemVerilog assertions, using overlapping implication (|->) with a sequence that spans multiple cycles can be done with ##[1:$] to indicate one or more cycles until the condition is met.

But for simplicity, perhaps the second assertion can be written to check that whenever a read completes (TIP falls and IF rises), rxr is valid, regardless of when the RD was set. But that might not capture the exact intent.

Alternatively, the second assertion is redundant if the first one is corrected to check for validity.

Given the user's original two assertions, perhaps the main corrections are:

1. Replace DataIO_Shift_Reg with a valid check on rxr.
2. Replace s_read_trigger with the condition that the RD bit is set.
3. Correct the disable iff conditions.

So the corrected assertions would be:

For p_rxr_read_update:

property p_rxr_read_update;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
  // Check RD was set & transfer completed (IF=1, TIP=0)
  ($past(cr[2]) && $rose(sr[0]) && !sr[3]) |-> !$isunknown(rxr);
endproperty

For p_rxr_valid_after_read:

property p_rxr_valid_after_read;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
  disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
  // Trigger on RD bit set, then check completion
  $rose(cr[2]) |-> ##[1:10] ($fell(sr[3]) && $rose(sr[0])) |-> !$isunknown(rxr);
endproperty

But the second part is more complex. Alternatively, use a sequence that starts when RD is set and completes when TIP falls and IF rises:

sequence read_complete;
  $fell(sr[3]) && $rose(sr[0]);
endsequence

property p_rxr_valid_after_read;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
  disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
  cr[2] |-> ##1 read_complete |-> !$isunknown(rxr);
endproperty

But timing might vary, so using ##[1:$] to allow any number of cycles between RD being set and the transfer completing.

Alternatively, the assertion can be written to check that after RD is set, eventually when the transfer completes, rxr is valid.

But for simplicity, given the user's original code, the corrected assertions would be:

1. p_rxr_read_update checks that after a read command (RD bit was set) and transfer completes, rxr is not unknown.
2. p_rxr_valid_after_read checks that when a read completes, rxr is valid.

But both assertions might be checking similar things. However, to adhere to the user's original intent, the first assertion focuses on the past RD bit and transfer completion, while the second focuses on the read trigger and subsequent completion.

Putting it all together, the corrected assertions without referencing undefined signals and with corrected disable conditions are as follows.
