It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

The Byte Command Controller tells the Bit Command Controller\nwhich operation has to be performed. For a single byte read, the Bit Command Controller\nreceives 8 separate read commands. Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SVAs for the signal sda_pad_oe based on the provided specification. Let's start by understanding the role of this signal.\n\nFirst, the description says sda_pad_oe is the output enable for the SDA line. It controls the tri-state buffer. When it's active (probably low, since in the Verilog example, when sda_padoen_oe is 0, sda is driven by sda_pad_o), the core drives SDA. When it's high, the core releases the bus (high impedance). \n\nNow, looking at the types of assertions needed: width, connectivity, and functionality. \n\nWidth assertion is straightforward. Since it's a 1-bit signal, check that its width is 1. That's easy.\n\nFor connectivity, I need to ensure that sda_pad_oe is properly connected and interacts correctly with related signals. The related signals are sda_pad_o and sda_pad_i. For example, when sda_pad_oe is low, the core is driving SDA, so sda_pad_o should be driving the line. When it's high, the core isn't driving, so SDA should be high-Z. But since the actual SDA line is external, maybe the connectivity checks are about the relationship between sda_pad_oe and other internal signals. Wait, the connectivity here might involve checking that when the core is supposed to drive SDA (like during a write), sda_pad_oe is asserted, and when it's receiving, it's not. But how to model that?\n\nFunctionality assertions would check the correct behavior according to the I2C protocol. For example, during a START condition, SDA should transition from high to low while SCL is high. The core should drive SDA low here, so sda_pad_oe should be active (0) to drive it. Similarly, during data transmission, when the core is sending a bit, sda_pad_oe should be active. When receiving an ACK, the core should release SDA (sda_pad_oe high) so the slave can pull it low.\n\nLooking at the architecture, the Bit Command Controller handles the actual driving of SDA and SCL. So when the core is transmitting data (WR command), sda_pad_oe should be low. When reading (RD command), it should be high during the data phase to let the slave drive. Also, during ACK phases, the master might drive (for ACK) or release (for NACK). Wait, the ACK bit in the Command Register (CR) determines if the master sends ACK (0) or NACK (1). So when sending ACK, sda_pad_oe should be low, driving SDA low. For NACK, the master releases SDA (sda_pad_oe high), allowing the pull-up to keep it high.\n\nAnother point: When the core is not enabled (EN bit in Control Register is 0), sda_pad_oe should be high to tri-state the SDA line. So maybe an assertion that when EN is 0, sda_pad_oe is 1.\n\nAlso, during arbitration loss (AL bit set), the core should release the bus, so sda_pad_oe should be high.\n\nLet me outline possible assertions:\n\n1. Width: Check sda_pad_oe is 1 bit.\n2. Connectivity: When sda_pad_oe is 0, sda_pad_o is driving the line. But since sda_pad_o is an output, maybe check that when oe is low, the core is driving (but how? Maybe check that during transmission phases, oe is low, and during reception, it's high).\n3. Functionality:\n   a. During START condition, sda_pad_oe is low to drive SDA low.\n   b. During STOP condition, sda_pad_oe is low to drive SDA high (since STOP is SDA going high while SCL is high).\n   c. During data transmission (WR), oe is low when the core is sending bits.\n   d. During data reception (RD), oe is high so slave can drive.\n   e. When EN is 0, oe is high.\n   f. After arbitration loss (AL is set), oe is high.\n   g. During ACK phase, if ACK bit is 0 (send ACK), oe is low; if ACK is 1 (NACK), oe is high.\n\nBut how to detect these conditions in the code? Need to relate to internal signals or register states.\n\nFor example, when the Command Register's WR bit is set, the core is transmitting, so oe should be low. Similarly, when RD is set, oe should be high. But the WR and RD bits are in the CR, which is write-only. However, the Status Register (SR) has TIP (transfer in progress) and other bits.\n\nAlternatively, during a write operation (WR command), the core is driving SDA, so oe should be low. When reading (RD command), oe should be high except when sending ACK/NACK.\n\nWait, during a read, the master sends the ACK/NACK after receiving the byte. So during the ACK phase, if the master is supposed to send ACK (ACK=0), oe should be low, driving SDA low. If NACK (ACK=1), oe should be high.\n\nBut how to track the state of the transfer? The Status Register's TIP bit indicates a transfer in progress. The AL bit indicates arbitration lost. The EN bit in Control Register enables the core.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n- When EN is 0, sda_pad_oe should be 1 (tri-stated).\n- When the core is not enabled, it's not driving SDA.\n\n- During a START condition (STA bit set in CR), sda_pad_oe should be low to drive SDA low.\n- During a STOP condition (STO bit set), sda_pad_oe should be low to drive SDA high, then release (oe goes high after? Wait, the STOP condition requires SDA to go high while SCL is high. The core would drive SDA high during the STOP generation, so oe would be low during that phase.\n\nBut how to detect when the core is generating START or STOP? The CR's STA and STO bits are write-only and cleared automatically. Maybe look at the state machine transitions in the Byte Command Controller.\n\nAlternatively, when the core is in a state where it's generating a START, STOP, or transmitting data, oe should be low. When receiving data or ACK, oe should be high.\n\nBut without internal state signals, it's challenging. However, the Status Register's TIP bit indicates a transfer is in progress. When TIP is high, the core is active.\n\nAnother approach: When the core is driving SDA (transmitting address, data, ACK, START, STOP), oe is low. When it's receiving (slave ACK, data from slave), oe is high.\n\nBut how to map this to assertions based on available signals?\n\nLooking at the example waveforms:\n\nIn Example 1, during the address and data phases (WR), the core drives SDA, so oe should be low. During the ACK phases, the slave drives, so oe should be high.\n\nWait, no. The ACK is generated by the slave, so during the 9th clock cycle (ACK), the master releases SDA (oe high), allowing the slave to pull it low. So during data transmission (first 8 bits), oe is low; during the 9th bit (ACK), oe is high.\n\nBut how to detect that in the code? The core's internal state machine would track which phase it's in. Since we don't have access to internal states, maybe use the TIP and other status bits.\n\nAlternatively, during a write operation (WR command), after the command is issued, the core transmits 8 bits (oe low), then releases for ACK (oe high). Similarly, during a read (RD command), the core releases SDA (oe high) for 8 bits, then drives ACK/NACK (oe low if ACK=0, high if ACK=1).\n\nBut again, without internal counters or phase tracking, this is hard. Maybe use the TIP signal and the command register's WR/RD bits.\n\nAnother angle: When the core is in a write operation (WR bit set in CR), sda_pad_oe should be low during data transmission. But the WR bit is cleared automatically, so maybe when the TIP is high and the last command was WR, oe is low.\n\nAlternatively, when the core is not in a read operation, oe is low. But this might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, check that whenever the core is driving SDA (like during START, STOP, or data write), oe is low. When it's not driving (like during ACK phase or reading), oe is high.\n\nBut how to trigger these conditions? Maybe use the Status Register's RxACK bit, TIP, and the Command Register's ACK bit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to outline possible assertions based on available signals:\n\n1. Width assertion: Check that sda_pad_oe is 1 bit wide.\n\n2. Connectivity: When sda_pad_oe is 0, sda_pad_o is being driven (but how to check that? Maybe not possible without knowing the expected value. Alternatively, check that when oe is 0, sda_pad_o is not in high-Z, but in Verilog, that's handled by the assign statements. Maybe this is covered by the functionality assertions.)\n\n3. Functionality:\n\n   a. When the core is disabled (EN bit in Control Register is 0), sda_pad_oe should be 1.\n\n   b. During a START condition (when STA is set and the core is initiating a transfer), sda_pad_oe should be driven low to pull SDA low.\n\n   c. During a STOP condition (when STO is set), sda_pad_oe should be driven low to pull SDA high, then released (oe goes high after STOP is done).\n\n   d. During data transmission (WR command), sda_pad_oe should be low when the core is sending data bits.\n\n   e. During data reception (RD command), sda_pad_oe should be high to allow the slave to drive SDA.\n\n   f. When arbitration is lost (AL bit in Status Register is 1), sda_pad_oe should be high to release the bus.\n\n   g. During ACK phase after transmitting a byte, if the master is sending ACK (ACK=0 in CR), sda_pad_oe should be low; if NACK (ACK=1), oe should be high.\n\nBut how to detect these scenarios in the code? Let's think about the available registers and signals.\n\nThe Control Register (CTR) has EN and IEN bits. The Status Register (SR) has RxACK, Busy, AL, TIP, IF. The Command Register (CR) has STA, STO, RD, WR, ACK, IACK.\n\nFor assertion a: When CTR.EN is 0, sda_pad_oe should be 1.\n\nFor assertion b: When a START is generated (STA is set and the core is enabled), during the START condition, sda_pad_oe should be low. But STA is auto-cleared, so maybe check that after setting STA and WR/RD, during the TIP, the oe is low when generating START.\n\nAlternatively, when the Busy bit transitions from 0 to 1 (indicating START detected), sda_pad_oe should be low.\n\nFor assertion d: When a WR command is issued (CR.WR is set), during TIP, sda_pad_oe is low.\n\nFor assertion e: When a RD command is issued (CR.RD is set), during TIP, sda_pad_oe is high.\n\nFor assertion f: When SR.AL is 1, sda_pad_oe should be 1.\n\nFor assertion g: After a byte transfer (TIP goes low and IF goes high), during the ACK phase, if CR.ACK was 0, oe should be low; else, high. But timing this is tricky.\n\nBut perhaps some of these can be translated into assertions based on the command and status registers.\n\nNow, considering the available signals and registers, here's how the assertions might look:\n\n- Width: Check sda_pad_oe is 1 bit.\n\n- Connectivity: When sda_pad_oe is 0, sda_pad_o is driven (but this is more of a structural check, maybe not an SVA). Alternatively, check that during transmission phases, oe is 0 and during reception, it's 1.\n\n- Functionality:\n\n  1. When core is disabled (CTR.EN == 0), sda_pad_oe should be 1.\n\n  2. During a START condition (when STA is set and TIP becomes 1), sda_pad_oe should be 0.\n\n  3. During a WR operation (CR.WR set and TIP high), sda_pad_oe should be 0.\n\n  4. During a RD operation (CR.RD set and TIP high), sda_pad_oe should be 1.\n\n  5. When arbitration is lost (SR.AL == 1), sda_pad_oe should be 1.\n\n  6. During ACK phase after WR, if ACK is 0, sda_pad_oe is 0; else 1. But how to detect the ACK phase?\n\nAlternatively, after a WR command completes (TIP falls), check that during the ACK phase, which is part of the transfer, but without internal state, it's hard. Maybe when the core is expecting an ACK (after WR), sda_pad_oe is 1 to allow the slave to drive.\n\nBut perhaps the key assertions are:\n\n- When EN is 0, oe is 1.\n\n- When transmitting (WR or STA/STO), oe is 0.\n\n- When receiving (RD), oe is 1.\n\n- On arbitration loss, oe is 1.\n\n- During STOP generation, oe is 0 to drive SDA high.\n\nBut again, how to detect STOP generation. Maybe when STO is set and TIP is high, oe is 0, and after STOP, oe becomes 1.\n\nPutting this all together, here are possible SVAs:\n\n1. Width assertion:\n\n   assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(sda_pad_oe) == 1);\n\n2. Connectivity: Maybe check that when oe is 0, sda_pad_o is driven (but since oe enables the output, this is inherent. Maybe no connectivity assertion needed beyond width.)\n\n3. Functionality:\n\n   a. Core disabled:\n\n      assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (ctr[7] == 0) |-> sda_pad_oe);\n\n      Assuming ctr[7] is the EN bit (from the Control Register description: EN is bit 7, IEN is bit 6).\n\n   b. During WR command and TIP:\n\n      property wr_oe;\n         @(posedge wb_clk_i) (cr[2] && sr[3]) |-> !sda_pad_oe;\n      endproperty\n      assert property (wr_oe);\n\n      Assuming cr[2] is the WR bit (from Command Register: bits are STA, STO, RD, WR, ACK, ...). sr[3] is TIP bit.\n\n   c. During RD command and TIP:\n\n      property rd_oe;\n         @(posedge wb_clk_i) (cr[3] && sr[3]) |-> sda_pad_oe;\n      endproperty\n      assert property (rd_oe);\n\n   d. Arbitration lost:\n\n      assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (sr[2]) |-> sda_pad_oe);\n\n      Assuming sr[2] is the AL bit.\n\n   e. During START generation:\n\n      When STA is set and TIP is high, oe should be 0.\n\n      property start_oe;\n         @(posedge wb_clk_i) $rose(sr[4]) |-> !sda_pad_oe;\n      endproperty\n      assert property (start_oe);\n\n      Assuming sr[4] is the Busy bit. When Busy rises, a START is detected.\n\n   f. During STOP generation:\n\n      When STO is set and TIP is high, oe should be 0 to drive SDA high, then after STOP, oe becomes 1.\n\n      But detecting the exact time of STOP is tricky. Maybe check that when STO is set and TIP is high, oe is 0, and after TIP falls, oe is 1.\n\n      property stop_oe;\n         @(posedge wb_clk_i) (cr[1] && sr[3]) |-> !sda_pad_oe;\n      endproperty\n      assert property (stop_oe);\n\n      Then, after STOP completes (Busy falls), oe should be 1.\n\n      assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $fell(sr[4]) |-> sda_pad_oe);\n\n   g. ACK phase after WR:\n\n      After a WR completes (TIP falls), during the ACK phase, the master releases SDA (oe high) to let the slave ACK.\n\n      But how to model this. Maybe after WR command, when TIP is high, during the 9th clock, oe is high.\n\n      This might require tracking the bit count, which isn't available. Alternatively, assume that after the 8 bits, during the 9th (ACK) cycle, oe is high.\n\n      But without internal counters, this is hard. Maybe this is covered by the RD assertion, where during RD, oe is high.\n\nAlternatively, when the core is expecting an ACK (after WR), oe should be high. But how to trigger that.\n\nGiven the complexity and the information available, the key assertions would be:\n\n- Width check.\n\n- Core disabled leads to oe high.\n\n- During WR and TIP, oe low.\n\n- During RD and TIP, oe high.\n\n- Arbitration lost leads to oe high.\n\n- START condition (Busy rising) leads to oe low.\n\n- STOP condition (Busy falling) leads to oe high.\n\nThese cover the main functionality points.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: Verify `sda_pad_oe` is 1-bit wide.\n2. **Core Disabled**: When the core is disabled (`ctr[7] = 0`), `sda_pad_oe` must be high to tri-state SDA.\n3. **Write Operations**: During active write transfers (`cr[2] = WR` and `sr[3] = TIP`), `sda_pad_oe` must be low to drive SDA.\n4. **Read Operations**: During read transfers (`cr[3] = RD` and `sr[3] = TIP`), `sda_pad_oe` must be high to allow slave-driven SDA.\n5. **Arbitration Lost**: If arbitration is lost (`sr[2] = AL`), `sda_pad_oe` must release the bus (high).\n6. **Start Condition**: When the bus becomes busy (`$rose(sr[4] = Busy`), `sda_pad_oe` must drive SDA low for START.\n7. **Stop Condition**: After the bus becomes idle (`$fell(sr[4] = Busy`), `sda_pad_oe` must release SDA (high).\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Direct check using `$bits`.\n- **Functionality**: Use register states (`ctr`, `cr`, `sr`) to trigger assertions at specific protocol phases.\n- **Connectivity**: Implicitly verified by ensuring `sda_pad_oe` behaves correctly relative to commands and status.\n\n```systemverilog\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(sda_pad_oe) == 1);\n\n// Core disabled: sda_pad_oe tri-stated\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (ctr[7] == 1'b0) |-> sda_pad_oe);\n\n// WR command active: drive SDA\nproperty wr_oe;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (cr[2] && sr[3]) |-> !sda_pad_oe;\nendproperty\nassert property (wr_oe);\n\n// RD command active: release SDA\nproperty rd_oe;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (cr[3] && sr[3]) |-> sda_pad_oe;\nendproperty\nassert property (rd_oe);\n\n// Arbitration lost: release bus\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) sr[2] |-> sda_pad_oe);\n\n// Start condition: drive SDA low\nproperty start_oe;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) $rose(sr[4]) |-> !sda_pad_oe;\nendproperty\nassert property (start_oe);\n\n// Stop condition: release SDA\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $fell(sr[4]) |-> sda_pad_oe);\n```"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "<think>\nOkay, let's break down the feedback process step by step. The user provided an answer with SVAs for the `sda_pad_oe` signal and wants a critical analysis. The goal is to identify every possible flaw, focusing on correctness, consistency, completeness, clock cycle misinterpretations, nested conditions, and long expressions.\n\nFirst, I'll start by reviewing each assertion one by one, cross-referencing with the specification and the workflow information provided.\n\n1. **Width Assertion**: The check for `$bits(sda_pad_oe) == 1` seems correct. The signal is defined as 1-bit, so this is valid.\n\n2. **Core Disabled/Reset Checks**:\n   - **Synchronous Disable**: The assertion `(ctr[7] == 0) |-> sda_pad_oe` is correct because when the core is disabled, SDA should be tri-stated.\n   - **Asynchronous Reset**: The check `$fell(arst_i) |-> sda_pad_oe` assumes active-low reset (ARST_LVL=0). However, the specification mentions that ARST_LVL can be configured as 0 or 1. The current assertion doesn't account for the parameter, making it incorrect for active-high reset configurations.\n\n3. **Write Command (Excluding ACK Phase)**:\n   - The property uses `$past(sr[3],1)` to exclude the first TIP cycle. However, the specification states that the ACK phase occurs on the 9th SCL cycle, not just the first TIP cycle. This approach might not accurately track the ACK phase, leading to potential false positives/negatives. Additionally, there's no check for SCL during the data phase, which is crucial for timing.\n\n4. **Read Command with ACK/NACK**:\n   - The assertion triggers on `$rose(sr[3])`, assuming the ACK phase starts when TIP rises. However, the ACK phase occurs after the 8 data bits, which isn't directly tied to the rising edge of TIP. This could misalign the assertion with the actual protocol timing. Also, the use of `cr[4]` (ACK bit) is correct but lacks synchronization with the SCL clock, risking metastability.\n\n5. **START/STOP with SCL Checks**:\n   - **Valid Start**: The check for `scl_pad_o` being high during START is correct. However, the specification requires SCL to be high when SDA transitions for START. The assertion checks `$rose(sr[4])` (Busy) but doesn't ensure SDA's transition during SCL high, missing a critical protocol rule.\n   - **Valid Stop**: Similarly, the STOP condition checks SCL high but doesn't verify the SDA transition from low to high during SCL high, leading to an incomplete check.\n\n6. **Arbitration Loss Handling**:\n   - The assertion `sr[2] |=> sda_pad_oe` ensures tri-state after arbitration loss. However, the specification states that arbitration loss should immediately release the bus. The use of `|=>` introduces a one-cycle delay, which might not align with the requirement for immediate release.\n\n7. **Repeated START Condition**:\n   - The assertion checks for `sr[4] && $rose(cr[0])` (Busy and STA rise). However, a Repeated START requires generating a START while the bus is already busy. The current check doesn't ensure that SCL is high during the Repeated START, risking protocol violation.\n\n**Additional Flaws**:\n- **Missing ACK Phase in WR**: The original answer attempts to exclude the ACK phase but doesn't explicitly handle the 9th cycle. A counter or SCL-based tracking is needed.\n- **No SCL Synchronization**: Most assertions lack checks for SCL state, leading to potential timing mismatches.\n- **Parameter Ignorance (ARST_LVL)**: The asynchronous reset assertion doesn't consider the configurable reset level, making it non-portable.\n- **Nested Conditions**: Some properties have complex conditions without proper parentheses, risking evaluation order issues.\n- **Liveness for Arbitration**: The arbitration loss assertion uses `|=>` but doesn't ensure persistent tri-state until reset.\n\n**Scoring Considerations**:\n- **Correctness**: Major issues with ACK phase handling, SCL checks, and reset configurability. (-30)\n- **Consistency**: Mixed use of signal checks (some with SCL, others without). (-20)\n- **Completeness**: Missing checks for SDA transitions during START/STOP and ACK phase in WR.

(+10)\n\n**Total Score**: -30 -20 -25 -15 -5 +10 = -85/100\n\n**Final Feedback**:\nThe SVAs have critical flaws in protocol timing alignment, SCL synchronization, and reset handling.

When active (as shown in the provided VHDL/Verilog examples), it disables the SDA driver (placing the line in high impedance) so that external pull-up resistors can pull the line high. When inactive, it allows sda_pad_o to drive the SDA line.\n    [Interconnection]: Works in conjunction with sda_pad_o and sda_pad_i within a tri-state buffer configuration to manage the bidirectional nature of the SDA line in the I2C interface.\n    [Additional information]: Essential for open-drain operation on the I2C bus, sda_pad_oe enables the proper alternation between driving the SDA line low and leaving it in a high-impedance state.

The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `sda_pad_oe` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. The key points from the feedback are that the original SVAs had issues with ACK phases, missing SCL checks, and incomplete handling of arbitration and repeated START conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to address the width assertion, which is straightforward. Then, ensure that when the core is disabled or in reset, `sda_pad_oe` is high. Next, handle the WR and RD commands correctly, making sure to exclude the ACK phase from the WR assertion and include the ACK phase in RD. Also, add checks for SCL during START and STOP conditions. Arbitration loss should force `sda_pad_oe` high, and repeated STARTs should be considered.\n\nFor the ACK phase in WR, after the 8 data bits, the 9th clock cycle is the ACK, where the master releases SDA. This means during WR commands, `sda_pad_oe` should be low for the first 8 cycles and high on the 9th. However, tracking the exact cycle might require a counter, which isn\'t mentioned in the spec. Instead, maybe use the TIP signal and the command register\'s state.\n\nFor RD commands, during the data phase (8 bits), `sda_pad_oe` should be high, but during the ACK phase, if the master is sending ACK (ACK=0), it should drive low. This requires checking the ACK bit in the command register during the appropriate phase.\n\nThe START condition must occur while SCL is high, so the assertion should include a check that SCL is high when START is detected. Similarly, STOP requires SCL high during the transition.\n\nRepeated STARTs are similar to regular STARTs but occur when the bus is already busy. The existing START assertion can be modified to account for this.\n\nArbitration loss should not only check when AL is set but also ensure that `sda_pad_oe` stays high until the core resets.\n\nPutting this all together, the revised SVAs should include:\n\n1. Width check.\n2. Core disabled and reset conditions.\n3. WR command with exclusion of ACK phase.\n4. RD command with ACK/NACK handling.\n5. START/STOP with SCL checks.\n6. Arbitration loss handling.\n7. Repeated START consideration.\n</think>\n\n[Reasoning Process]\n1. **Width Check**: Direct verification using `$bits`.\n2. **Core Disabled/Reset**: Account for both synchronous (`ctr[7]`) and asynchronous (`arst_i`) reset conditions.\n3. **WR Command**: Exclude ACK phase using `$past()` to track TIP duration.\n4. **RD Command**: Add ACK/NACK check using `cr[4]` during TIP.\n5. **START/STOP**: Add SCL state checks (`scl_pad_o`) for protocol compliance.\n6. **Arbitration Loss**: Use liveness condition (`|=>`) to ensure persistent tri-state.\n7. **Repeated START**: Allow START assertion during Busy state.\n\n[Verification]\n- **Width**: Explicit check for 1-bit width.\n- **Functionality**: Refined assertions cover ACK phases, SCL timing, and arbitration.\n- **Connectivity**: Implicit via protocol-driven behavior checks.\n\n```systemverilog\n// --------------------------\n// Width Assertion\n// --------------------------\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(sda_pad_oe) == 1);\n\n// --------------------------\n// Core Disabled/Reset Checks\n// --------------------------\n// Synchronous disable\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (ctr[7] == 0) |-> sda_pad_oe);\n// Asynchronous reset (ARST_LVL=0)\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $fell(arst_i) |-> sda_pad_oe);\n\n// --------------------------\n// Write Command (Excluding ACK Phase)\n// --------------------------\nproperty wr_data_phase;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (cr[2] && sr[3] && $past(sr[3],1)) |-> !sda_pad_oe; // Exclude first TIP cycle (ACK phase)\nendproperty\nassert property (wr_data_phase);\n\n// --------------------------\n// Read Command with ACK/NACK\n// --------------------------\nproperty rd_ack_phase;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (cr[3] && sr[3] && $rose(sr[3])) |-> // ACK phase starts after TIP rises\n  (cr[4] ? sda_pad_oe : !sda_pad_oe); // ACK=1 (NACK) ? tri-state : drive low\nendproperty\nassert property (rd_ack_phase);\n\n// --------------------------\n// START/STOP with SCL Checks\n// --------------------------\nproperty valid_start;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  $rose(sr[4]) && scl_pad_o |-> !sda_pad_oe; // SCL high during START\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_start);\n\nproperty valid_stop;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  $fell(sr[4]) && scl_pad_o |-> sda_pad_oe; // SCL high during STOP\nendproperty\nassert property (valid_stop);\n\n// --------------------------\n// Arbitration Loss Handling\n// --------------------------\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) sr[2] |=> sda_pad_oe); // Persistent tri-state\n\n// --------------------------\n// Repeated START Condition\n// --------------------------\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (sr[4] && $rose(cr[0])) |-> !sda_pad_oe // STA asserted while Busy\n);\n```.\n\nAccording to the Feedback: <think>\nOkay, let\'s break down the feedback process step by step.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to generate SVAs for the `sda_pad_oe` signal based on the provided specification and previous feedback. The key points from the feedback are that the original SVAs had issues with ACK phases, missing SCL checks, and incomplete handling of arbitration and repeated START conditions.

First, I need to address the width assertion, which is straightforward. Then, ensure that when the core is disabled or in reset, `sda_pad_oe` is high. Next, handle the WR and RD commands correctly, making sure to exclude the ACK phase from the WR assertion and include the ACK phase in RD. Also, add checks for SCL during START and STOP conditions. Arbitration loss should force `sda_pad_oe` high, and repeated STARTs should be considered.

For the ACK phase in WR, after the 8 data bits, the 9th clock cycle is the ACK, where the master releases SDA. This means during WR commands, `sda_pad_oe` should be low for the first 8 cycles and high on the 9th. However, tracking the exact cycle might require a counter, which isn't mentioned in the spec. Instead, maybe use the TIP signal and the command register's state.

For RD commands, during the data phase (8 bits), `sda_pad_oe` should be high, but during the ACK phase, if the master is sending ACK (ACK=0), it should drive low. This requires checking the ACK bit in the command register during the appropriate phase.

The START condition must occur while SCL is high, so the assertion should include a check that SCL is high when START is detected. Similarly, STOP requires SCL high during the transition.

Repeated STARTs are similar to regular STARTs but occur when the bus is already busy. The existing START assertion can be modified to account for this.

Arbitration loss should not only check when AL is set but also ensure that `sda_pad_oe` stays high until the core resets.

Putting this all together, the revised SVAs should include:

1. Width check.
2. Core disabled and reset conditions.
3. WR command with exclusion of ACK phase.
4. RD command with ACK/NACK handling.
5. START/STOP with SCL checks.
6. Arbitration loss handling.
7. Repeated START consideration.
