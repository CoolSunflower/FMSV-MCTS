It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional\ncommunication over a short distance between many devices. The PC standard is a true\nmulti-master bus including collision detection and arbitration that prevents data\ncorruption if two or more masters attempt to control the bus simultaneously.\n\nThe interface defines 3 transmission speeds:\n- Normal: 100Kbps\n\n- Fast: 400Kbps\n\n- High speed: 3.5Mbps\n\nOnly 100Kbps and 400Kbps modes are supported directly. For High speed special IOs\nare needed. If these IOs are available and used, then High speed is also supported.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatible with Philips PC standard\n\nMulti Master Operation\n\nSoftware programmable clock frequency\n\nClock Stretching and Wait state generation\n\nSoftware programmable acknowledge bit\n\nInterrupt or bit-polling driven byte-by-byte data-transfers\nArbitration lost interrupt, with automatic transfer cancelation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start/Acknowledge generation\nStart/Stop/Repeated Start detection\n\nBus busy detection\n\nSupports 7 and 10bit addressing mode\n\nOperates from a wide range of input clock frequencies\nStatic synchronous design\n\nFully synthesizable\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 1 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n2\nIO ports\n\n2.1 Core Parameters\n\nParameter Type | Default | Description\nARST_LVL Bit | 1’b0 Asynchronous reset level\n\n2.1.1 ARST_LVL\n\nThe asynchronous reset level can be set to either active high (1’b1) or active low (1’b0).\n\n2.2 WISHBONE interface signals\n\nPort _ Direction | Description\nwb_ clk _ i Input Master clock\n\n|wb_dati_| 8 | Input____| Datatowardsthecore\n\n|wb_dato | 8 | Output | Datafromthecore\npop ah Top Seah ee te pet\nfw _intao [1 [Output [interrupt signal output\n\nThe core features a WISHBONE RevB.3 compliant WISHBONE Classic interface.

All devices connected to these two signals must have open drain or open\ncollector outputs. The logic AND function is exercised on both lines with external pull-up\nresistors.\n\nData is transferred between a Master and a Slave synchronously to SCL on the SDA line\non a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8 bits long. There is one SCL clock pulse for\neach data bit with the MSB being transmitted first. An acknowledge bit follows each\ntransferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA\nline may be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during\nthe high period of SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a\ncommand (see START and STOP signals).\n\n4.2 ’C Protocol\n\nNormally, a standard communication consists of four parts:\n1) START signal generation\n\n2) Slave address transfer\n\n3) Data transfer\n\n4) STOP signal generation\n\nMSB LSB MSB LSB\nSCL \\_S NSS NS aS s\\ Se SAS e\\ SNS NS oS aS aS SS oS aS \\_/\n\nSDA s / a7 X 6 X ASX AA X AB X A2 KX A1 X RW \\ACK/ D7 X D6 X DS X D4 X D3 X D2 X D1 X DO /NACK\\ P\n\n4.2.1 START signal\n\nWhen the bus is free/idle, meaning no master device is engaging the bus (both SCL and\nSDA lines are high), a master can initiate a transfer by sending a START signal. A\nSTART signal, usually referred to as the S-bit, is defined as a high-to-low transition of\nSDA while SCL is high. The START signal denotes the beginning of a new data transfer.\nA Repeated START is a START signal without first generating a STOP signal. The\nmaster uses this method to communicate with another slave or the same slave in a\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 7 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\ndifferent transfer direction (e.g. from writing to a device to reading from a device)\nwithout releasing the bus.\n\nThe core generates a START signal when the STA-bit in the Command Register is set\nand the RD or WR bits are set. Depending on the current status of the SCL line, a START\nor Repeated START is generated.\n\n4.2.2 Slave Address Transfer\n\nThe first byte of data transferred by the master immediately after the START signal is the\nslave address. This is a seven-bits calling address followed by a RW bit. The RW bit\nsignals the slave the data transfer direction. No two slaves in the system can have the\nsame address. Only the slave with an address that matches the one transmitted by the\nmaster will respond by returning an acknowledge bit by pulling the SDA low at the 9th\nSCL clock cycle.\n\nNote: The core supports 10bit slave addresses by generating two address transfers. See\nthe Philips °C specifications for more details.\n\nThe core treats a Slave Address Transfer as any other write action. Store the slave\ndevice’s address in the Transmit Register and set the WR bit. The core will then transfer\nthe slave address on the bus.\n\n4.2.3 Data Transfer\n\nOnce successful slave addressing has been achieved, the data transfer can proceed on a\nbyte-by-byte basis in the direction specified by the RW bit sent by the master. Each\ntransferred byte is followed by an acknowledge bit on the 9th SCL clock cycle. If the\nslave signals a No Acknowledge, the master can generate a STOP signal to abort the data\ntransfer or generate a Repeated START signal and start a new transfer cycle.\n\nIf the master, as the receiving device, does not acknowledge the slave, the slave releases\nthe SDA line for the master to generate a STOP or Repeated START signal.\n\nTo write data to a slave, store the data to be transmitted in the Transmit Register and set\nthe WR bit. To read data from a slave, set the RD bit. During a transfer the core set the\nTIP flag, indicating that a Transfer is In Progress. When the transfer is done the TIP flag\nis reset, the IF flag set and, when enabled, an interrupt generated. The Receive Register\ncontains valid data after the IF flag has been set. The user may issue a new write or read\ncommand when the TIP flag is reset.\n\n4.2.4 STOP signal\n\nThe master can terminate the communication by generating a STOP signal. A STOP\nsignal, usually referred to as the P-bit, is defined as a low-to-high transition of SDA while\nSCL 1s at logical ‘1’.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 8 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n4.3 Arbitration Procedure\n\n4.3.1 Clock Synchronization\n\nThe [°C bus is a true multimaster bus that allows more than one master to be connected\non it. If two or more masters simultaneously try to control the bus, a clock\nsynchronization procedure determines the bus clock. Because of the wired-AND\nconnection of the ’C signals a high to low transition affects all devices connected to the\nbus. Therefore a high to low transition on the SCL line causes all concerned devices to\ncount off their low period. Once a device clock has gone low it will hold the SCL line in\nthat state until the clock high state is reached. Due to the wired-AND connection the SCL\nline will therefore be held low by the device with the longest low period, and held high\nby the device with the shortest high period.\n\nStart counting Start counting\nlow period high period\n\nSCL1 Master1 SCL\nSCL2 Master2 SCL\nSCL wired-AND SCL\n\n4.3.2 Clock Stretching\n\nSlave devices can use the clock synchronization mechanism to slow down the transfer bit\nrate. After the master has driven SCL low, the slave can drive SCL low for the required\nperiod and then release it. If the slave’s SCL low period is greater than the master’s SCL\nlow period, the resulting SCL bus signal low period is stretched, thus inserting wait-\nstates.\n\nWwww.opencores.org Rev 0.8 Preliminary 9 of 15\n\n\nOpenCores P’C-Master core 7/3/2003\n\n5\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe I2C core is built around four primary blocks; the Clock Generator, the Byte\nCommand Controller, the Bit Command Controller and the DataIO Shift Register.\nAll other blocks are used for interfacing or for storing temporary values.\n\nclock\ngenerator\n\nPrescale\nRegister\n\nCommand\nRegister Byte Bit SCL\nCommand Command\n| Status a Controller Controller SDA\nRegister\n\nTransmi\n\nRegister\n—_ Shift\n\nRecei Register\n\nRegister\n\nFig. 5.1 Internal structure I2C Master Core\n\nWISHBONE\nInterface\n\n5.1 Clock Generator\n\nThe Clock Generator generates an internal 4*Fscl clock enable signal that triggers all\nsynchronous elements in the Bit Command Controller.

Each bit-operation is divided into 5 pieces (idle and\nA, B, C, and D), except for a STOP operation which is divided into 4 pieces (idle and A,\nB, and C).\n\nStart SCL «| \\\n\nRep Start SCL / \\\n\nStop SCL i/\nWrite SCL i/ \\\n\nRead SCL ane\nspa TOOK OO\n\n5.4 DatalO Shift Register\n\nThe DatalIO Shift Register contains the data associated with the current transfer.

It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.\n### 1. WISHBONE Interface\n- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).\n- **Operation**:  \n  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  \n  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.\n### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator\n- **Prescale Register**:  \n  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  \n  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  \n- **Clock Generator**:  \n  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  \n  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.\n### 3. Control & Status Registers\n- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  \n  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  \n  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  \n- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).\n### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller\n- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  \n  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  \n  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.\n- **Byte Command Controller**:  \n  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  \n    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  \n    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  \n    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  \n    4. Generating STOP if required.  \n  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.\n### 5. Bit Command Controller\n- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:\n  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  \n  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  \n  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.\n- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  \n  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  \n  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.\n### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers\n- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  \n  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  \n  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  \n- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  \n  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  \n- **DataIO Shift Register**:  \n  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  \n  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  \n  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.\n### 7. Typical Transaction Flow\n1. **Configuration**:  \n   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  \n   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  \n2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  \n   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  \n   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  \n   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  \n3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  \n   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  \n   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  \n   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  \n   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  \n4. **Generate STOP**:  \n   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.\n### 8. Summary\nPutting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:\n- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,\n- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,\n- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),\n- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,\n- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.\nThis layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.\n\nHere is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:\n\n**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  \n  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  \n  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  \n  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  \n  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  \n  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  \n  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  \n  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  \n  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  \n  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  \n  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  \n  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  \n  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  \n  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  \n  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  \n  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  \n  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  \n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  \n- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  \n- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)\n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**\n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  \n  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  \n  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  \n  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  \n  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  \n  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  \n  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  \n  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  \n  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.\n  \n**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)\n**[Signals]:**  \n- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  \n- **SDA** (Serial Data)  \n**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  \n- **[Timing Relationship]:**  \n  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  \n  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  \n  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  \n  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.\n- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  \n  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  \n  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  \n  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.\n- **[State Transitions]:**  \n  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  \n  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  \n  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  \n  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.\n- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  \n  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  \n  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  \n  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  \n  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.\n- **[Additional Observations]:**  \n  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  \n  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) for the status register (sr) based on the provided specification. Let's start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, the signal sr is an 8-bit read-only register. The specification mentions several bits: RxACK (bit 7), Busy (bit 6), AL (bit 5), reserved bits (4:2), TIP (bit 1), and IF (bit 0). The SVAs should cover width, connectivity, and functionality checks.\n\nFor width, I need to ensure that sr is always 8 bits wide. That's straightforward using $bits(sr) == 8.\n\nNext, connectivity. The status register is read-only, so when the Wishbone address (wb_adr_i) points to sr's address (0x04), and during a read cycle (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, wb_we_i is low), the data output (wb_dat_o) should reflect sr's value. Also, since it's read-only, writes to this address should not affect sr. But since the register is read-only, the value of sr shouldn't change when written. However, the spec says it's read-only, so maybe the connectivity assertion should check that when the address is 0x04 and it's a read, wb_dat_o matches sr.\n\nFor functionality, each bit has specific conditions. Let's break them down:\n\n1. RxACK (bit 7): This bit is set when no acknowledge is received from the slave. So, after a transfer completes (TIP falls), if the received ACK is not present, RxACK should be high. But how to track when a transfer completes? Maybe check that when TIP goes from high to low, RxACK reflects the correct state. However, the exact condition for RxACK might depend on internal signals not provided here. Since the spec says RxACK is '1' when no ACK received, perhaps an assertion that whenever sr[7] is high, it's because the last transaction didn't get an ACK. But without internal signals, this might be tricky. Maybe assume that the core correctly sets this bit based on its internal logic.\n\n2. Busy (bit 6): This should be high after a START condition is detected and low after a STOP. So, when a START is issued (STA command in CR), Busy should go high. When a STOP is issued (STO command), Busy should go low. Also, if the core detects a START or STOP on the bus (in multi-master scenarios), Busy should update accordingly. But how to detect those events from the given signals? The scl_pad_i and sda_pad_i are inputs, so maybe monitor those for START/STOP conditions. A START is SDA high to low while SCL is high. A STOP is SDA low to high while SCL is high. So, when a START is detected on the bus, Busy should be high until a STOP is detected. However, the core's Busy bit is set when it detects a START and cleared on STOP. So assertions could check that Busy is high from START until STOP.\n\n3. AL (bit 5): Set when arbitration is lost. Arbitration loss can happen if the core drives SDA high but it's low, or detects a STOP it didn't generate. So, if the core is driving SDA (sda_pad_oe is active) and sda_pad_i is low while sda_pad_o is high, that's a conflict, leading to AL. Also, if a STOP is detected without the core generating it (STO not set), AL should be set. So assertions can check that when such conditions occur, AL is set.\n\n4. Reserved bits (4:2): Should always be 0. So, an assertion that these bits are never set.\n\n5. TIP (bit 1): High during a transfer. When a command (RD or WR) is issued, TIP should go high and stay high until the transfer completes. So, when CR's WR or RD is set, TIP should become high until the transfer finishes (IF goes high, TIP goes low).\n\n6. IF (bit 0): Set when a transfer completes or arbitration is lost. So, when TIP falls, IF should rise. Also, when AL is set, IF should be set. Additionally, writing IACK in CR should clear IF.\n\nOther considerations: The status register is read-only, so any write to its address should not modify it. Also, after reset, sr should be 0x00.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nWidth assertion: Check sr is 8 bits.\n\nConnectivity: When reading from address 0x04, wb_dat_o equals sr. Also, writes to sr's address don't change sr.\n\nFunctionality assertions:\n\n- Reserved bits are always 0.\n- Busy is high after START, low after STOP.\n- When arbitration is lost (AL condition), AL bit is set.\n- TIP is high during transfers, low otherwise.\n- IF is set on transfer completion or arbitration loss, cleared by IACK.\n- RxACK reflects the lack of ACK after a transfer.\n\nBut some conditions might require internal signals not visible here. For example, knowing when a transfer completes or when an ACK is received. Since the spec doesn't provide those, the assertions might need to rely on the TIP and IF bits.\n\nPossible assertions:\n\n1. Width: assert property ($bits(sr) == 8);\n\n2. Connectivity: When reading sr, wb_dat_o matches sr.\n\n3. Functionality:\n   - Reserved bits are 0: always (sr[4:2] == 3'b0);\n   - Busy is high when the bus is active (after START, until STOP).\n   - When AL condition occurs, AL bit is set.\n   - TIP is high during transfers (when CR.RD or CR.WR is set, until IF is set).\n   - IF is set when TIP falls or AL is set, and cleared when IACK is written.\n   - RxACK is high when no ACK was received.\n\nBut how to detect the ACK status? Maybe when a transfer completes (TIP goes low), if RxACK is high, then no ACK was received. But without the internal signal for ACK, this might be inferred from the command and the bus activity.\n\nAlternatively, since the core sets RxACK based on the received ACK, the assertion could check that whenever the core is in a state where it expects an ACK (after sending a byte), the RxACK bit reflects the actual SDA line during the ACK phase.\n\nBut given the information available, perhaps the assertions can check that after a write command (WR) is issued and TIP goes low, the RxACK bit is set if the slave didn't acknowledge. However, without knowing the exact timing of when the ACK is sampled, this might be challenging.\n\nIn the absence of internal signals, the assertions might focus on the relationships between the command register, status bits, and the bus signals.\n\nFor example:\n\n- After a START is generated (STA bit set in CR), Busy should be high until a STOP is detected.\n- When arbitration is lost (e.g., sda_pad_i is low while the core is driving it high), AL is set.\n- When a transfer is in progress (TIP high), any new command (RD/WR) isn't accepted until TIP goes low.\n- The IF bit is set whenever a transfer completes (TIP falls) or arbitration is lost, and cleared when IACK is written.\n\nAlso, after reset, sr should be 0.\n\nSo, putting all this into SVAs:\n\nWidth check is straightforward.\n\nConnectivity: When the address is 0x04 and it's a read, wb_dat_o should equal sr.\n\nReserved bits check: Always 0.\n\nBusy assertion: When a START condition is detected (sda_pad_i transitions high to low while scl_pad_i is high), Busy goes high. Busy stays high until a STOP condition (sda_pad_i transitions low to high while scl_pad_i is high).\n\nBut detecting START/STOP on the bus might be part of the core's function. Alternatively, since the core's Busy bit is set when it detects a START, the assertion can check that Busy is high after the core issues a START (STA command) and until it issues a STOP (STO command).\n\nBut the core can also detect START/STOP from other masters. So the Busy bit reflects the bus state, not just the core's own actions.\n\nThis complicates things. Maybe the assertion should check that Busy is high whenever the bus is not idle (i.e., after a START until a STOP).\n\nBut how to detect bus busy from the external signals? The bus is busy between START and STOP. So when scl_pad_i and sda_pad_i are not both high, the bus is busy. But the core's Busy bit should mirror this.\n\nAlternatively, the spec says that the Busy bit is set after a START is detected and cleared after a STOP. So the assertion can check that whenever a START is detected (on the bus), Busy becomes 1, and remains 1 until a STOP is detected.\n\nBut detecting START/STOP on the bus requires monitoring scl_pad_i and sda_pad_i.\n\nFor example, a START is when sda_pad_i falls while scl_pad_i is high. A STOP is when sda_pad_i rises while scl_pad_i is high.\n\nSo, the assertion could be:\n\nproperty bus_busy_start_stop;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  $rose(sr[6]) |-> (scl_pad_i && $fell(sda_pad_i)) // START detected\n  ##1 sr[6] throughout ($fell(sr[6]) [->1]) // Busy remains high until STOP\n  ##1 (scl_pad_i && $rose(sda_pad_i)); // STOP detected\nendproperty\n\nBut this might be too simplistic. Alternatively, whenever a START occurs, Busy should go high and stay high until a STOP.\n\nAnother approach: After a START is detected, Busy is 1 until a STOP is detected. So:\n\nsequence start_condition;\n  scl_pad_i && $fell(sda_pad_i);\nendsequence\n\nsequence stop_condition;\n  scl_pad_i && $rose(sda_pad_i);\nendsequence\n\nproperty busy_high_after_start;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  start_condition |=> sr[6] throughout (stop_condition[->1]);\nendproperty\n\nBut this might not account for the core's internal detection. Also, the Busy bit is set by the core when it detects a START, which could be from another master. So the assertion should check that whenever a START is detected on the bus, the Busy bit is set, and remains set until a STOP is detected.\n\nHowever, the core's Busy bit is part of the status register, which is internal. The actual detection of START/STOP by the core might have some latency. So the assertion needs to allow for that.\n\nAlternatively, since the Busy bit is part of the status register, which is read-only, the connectivity assertion ensures that when the address is 0x04, the value is correctly presented on wb_dat_o.\n\nFor the AL bit: Arbitration lost occurs when the core is driving SDA high (sda_pad_oe is active and sda_pad_o is high) but the actual SDA line is low (sda_pad_i is low). So when sda_pad_oe is 0 (core driving SDA), sda_pad_o is 1, but sda_pad_i is 0, then AL should be set.\n\nproperty arbitration_lost;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (sda_padoen_o == 0) && (sda_pad_o == 1) && (sda_pad_i == 0) |-> sr[5];\nendproperty\n\nBut need to check if the core sets AL in this case.\n\nFor TIP: When a command (WR or RD) is issued, TIP should go high and stay high until the transfer completes (IF is set). So, when CR.WR or CR.RD is set, TIP should go high on the next clock, and stay high until IF is set.\n\nproperty tip_high_during_transfer;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (cr[3] || cr[2]) |=> sr[1] throughout (sr[0][->1]);\nendproperty\n\nBut this might not capture the exact behavior. Alternatively, when a WR or RD command is issued (CR.WR or CR.RD is set), TIP becomes 1 and remains 1 until IF is set (transfer complete or arbitration lost).\n\nFor IF: It should be set when TIP falls or when AL is set. Also, writing IACK (CR[0]) should clear IF.\n\nproperty if_set_on_tip_fall_or_al;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  $fell(sr[1]) |-> sr[0];\nendproperty\n\nproperty if_clear_on_iack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (cr[0] && wb_we_i && wb_adr_i == 3'h4) |=> !sr[0];\nendproperty\n\nBut need to ensure that IACK write clears IF.\n\nFor RxACK: After a transfer (TIP falls), if the slave didn't ACK, RxACK is high. But without knowing the ACK status, this is tricky. Maybe when the core is in a write state and after TIP falls, RxACK reflects the received ACK. But how to track that? Perhaps when a write command is issued and completed, check RxACK based on the expected ACK. However, without internal signals, this might not be feasible. Maybe assume that the core correctly sets RxACK based on its internal logic, and the assertion is that whenever a transfer completes (TIP falls), RxACK is valid based on the transaction.\n\nBut given the information, perhaps the only feasible assertion is that after a write command, if no ACK is received, RxACK is high. But how to detect that? Maybe when the core is expecting an ACK (after sending a byte), and the SDA line is high during the ACK phase, then RxACK should be high.\n\nBut the ACK phase is the 9th SCL cycle. Monitoring SCL and SDA during that time would be needed. However, without knowing the exact timing or internal state, this is challenging.\n\nAlternatively, since the spec says RxACK is '1' when no acknowledge is received, an assertion could check that whenever sr[7] is high, it's because during the ACK phase, SDA was high. But again, without internal counters or state, this might not be possible.\n\nGiven the constraints, the assertions will focus on the bits that can be checked with the available signals.\n\nPutting it all together, the SVAs would include:\n\n- Width check for sr being 8 bits.\n- Connectivity: When reading sr's address, wb_dat_o matches sr.\n- Reserved bits are always 0.\n- Busy is high after a START condition on the bus and low after a STOP.\n- AL is set when arbitration is lost (SDA conflict).\n- TIP is high during transfers.\n- IF is set on transfer completion or arbitration loss, cleared by IACK.\n- RxACK is high when no ACK received (but specifics depend on internal logic).\n\nNow, translating these into SVAs with the given signals.\n\nFor example:\n\n// Width assertion\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(sr) == 8);\n\n// Connectivity: When reading status register, data output matches sr\nproperty sr_connectivity;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && !wb_we_i && (wb_adr_i == 3'h4)) |-> (wb_dat_o == sr);\nendproperty\nassert property (sr_connectivity);\n\n// Reserved bits are 0\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (sr[4:2] == 3'b0));\n\n// Busy is high after START, low after STOP\nsequence start_detected;\n  scl_pad_i && $fell(sda_pad_i);\nendsequence\n\nsequence stop_detected;\n  scl_pad_i && $rose(sda_pad_i);\nendsequence\n\nproperty busy_after_start;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  start_detected |=> sr[6] throughout (stop_detected[->1]);\nendproperty\nassert property (busy_after_start);\n\n// AL set on arbitration loss\nproperty arbitration_lost_check;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (sda_padoen_o && (sda_pad_o != sda_pad_i)) |-> sr[5];\nendproperty\nassert property (arbitration_lost_check);\n\n// TIP high during transfer\nproperty tip_high_during_transfer;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (cr[3] || cr[2]) |=> sr[1];\nendproperty\nassert property (tip_high_during_transfer);\n\n// IF set on TIP fall or AL set\nproperty if_set;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  ($fell(sr[1]) || $rose(sr[5])) |-> sr[0];\nendproperty\nassert property (if_set);\n\n// IF cleared on IACK\nproperty if_clear;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  (cr[0] && wb_we_i && wb_adr_i == 3'h4) |=> !sr[0];\nendproperty\nassert property (if_clear);\n\n// RxACK set when no ACK received (simplified)\n// This might need internal knowledge, but assuming that after a transfer, if no ACK, RxACK is high\nproperty rxack_no_ack;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i)\n  $fell(sr[1]) |-> (sr[7] == !sda_pad_i); // Assuming sda_pad_i is low when ACK is received\nendproperty\nassert property (rxack_no_ack);\n\nWait, but the RxACK bit is '1' when no ACK is received. The ACK is indicated by the slave pulling SDA low during the 9th clock cycle. So if during the ACK phase (after 8 data bits), SDA is high, then RxACK should be '1'. But detecting the ACK phase requires tracking the SCL cycles, which might not be feasible without internal counters. However, the core's status register should capture this correctly. So perhaps the assertion is that when a transfer completes (TIP falls), the RxACK bit reflects the SDA line during the ACK phase. But without knowing when the ACK phase occurs, this is hard to capture.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that after a write command, the core expects an ACK. So when the transfer completes, if SDA was high during the ACK phase, RxACK is '1'. But how to know when that phase occurred? Maybe sample sda_pad_i at the time when the ACK is expected. But without internal timing, this is challenging.\n\nGiven the limitations, perhaps the RxACK assertion is omitted or simplified, relying on the core's correct behavior.\n\nAnother approach: After a write command (WR bit set), when the transfer completes (TIP falls), check that RxACK is high if the slave didn't ACK. But without knowing the slave's response, this can't be directly asserted.

The user wants me to generate SVAs for the status register (sr) based on the provided specification and feedback. First, I need to recall the previous answer and the feedback given. \n\nThe previous SVAs had several issues: using assume instead of assert for reserved bits, missing arbitration cases, not handling both reset signals, and some syntax errors in the properties. The feedback also pointed out that some sequences like start_cond and stop_cond were not declared, leading to errors.\n\nStarting with the width assertion. The original code used a simple check, but it didn't consider the asynchronous reset arst_i. I need to include both wb_rst_i and arst_i in the disable iff conditions.\n\nNext, the connectivity assertion. The original code had a property that checked if reading the status register address (0x04) would result in wb_dat_o matching sr. However, the Wishbone protocol requires an acknowledgment (wb_ack_o), so the property should include a check for wb_ack_o in the same or next cycle. Also, the spec mentions that each access takes two cycles, so using ##1 makes sense here.\n\nFor the reserved bits, the mistake was using assume instead of assert. I need to correct that to an assert property and ensure it's active unless reset.\n\nThe Busy flag property had a sequence that wasn't declared, causing errors. I need to define start_cond and stop_cond properly. The start condition is SDA falling while SCL is high, and stop is SDA rising while SCL is high. Also, the Busy flag should stay high until a stop condition is detected, so using throughout is appropriate, but I need to make sure the sequences are correctly declared.\n\nArbitration lost detection had an issue with the sda_padoen_o signal not being declared. Looking back at the spec, sda_padoen_o is the output enable for SDA, active low. So the correct condition is when the core is driving SDA (!sda_padoen_o) and there's a conflict between sda_pad_o and sda_pad_i. Also, the spec mentions arbitration can be lost due to unexpected STOP conditions, so adding a check for that is necessary.\n\nThe TIP lifecycle property needed to ensure TIP remains high during transfers. The original code used until_with $fell(sr[1]), which might not cover all cases. Instead, tracking the command register bits (cr[3] or cr[2]) until TIP falls would be better.\n\nInterrupt flag handling missed the IACK clearing. When the IACK bit is written, the IF should clear. The command register is at address 0x04, so writing to that address with the IACK bit set should trigger the clear. Also, combining TIP falling and AL rising ensures all interrupt conditions are covered.\n\nFor RxACK, the original ack_phase sequence wasn't correctly capturing the 9th SCL cycle. Instead of a complex sequence, using a counter to track SCL edges up to the 9th cycle would be more accurate. Also, during a read command (cr[3]), the RxACK bit should reflect the slave's ACK/NACK on the 9th SCL cycle.\n\nFinally, considering the syntax errors reported, all used signals like sda_padoen_o, start_cond, stop_cond, and ack_phase must be properly declared or defined within the assertions to avoid compilation errors. Also, including both reset signals (wb_rst_i and arst_i) in disable iff conditions ensures the assertions are properly gated during resets.\n\nPutting it all together, each assertion must be checked for correct syntax, proper signal references, and alignment with the spec's functionality.

LLM Output: <think>

Okay, let's go through this step by step. The user provided an answer with SVAs for the status register (sr) and wants a strict critique. I need to analyze each assertion for correctness, consistency, completeness, and potential issues.

First, looking at the width check. The assertion checks that sr is 8 bits. That's correct, but the spec says sr is 8 bits, so this is valid. However, the disable condition uses both wb_rst_i and arst_i. The spec mentions that arst_i is asynchronous and active level depends on ARST_LVL parameter. The current code assumes active high for both resets, but if ARST_LVL is 0 (default), arst_i is active low. The disable iff should account for the actual reset polarity. This is a flaw because it doesn't use ARST_LVL to determine the active level.

Next, the connectivity assertion. It checks that reading address 0x04 returns sr. The spec says each Wishbone access takes two cycles. The code uses ##1 wb_ack_o, which might not align if the acknowledge comes later. Also, wb_ack_o is an output; the property should check that after a read request, wb_ack_o is asserted and data is correct. However, the code uses ##1, which assumes the ack comes in the next cycle. If the core takes exactly two cycles, this is okay, but if variable latency is possible, this could miss. Not sure from the spec, but the spec says each access takes two cycles, so ##1 is correct. However, the address check uses 3'h4, which is 3 bits, but wb_adr_i's width isn't specified. If the address bus is wider, this could be a problem. The spec mentions wb_adr_i as "lower address bits," so maybe only the lower 3 bits are used. It's a potential inconsistency if more bits are ignored.

Reserved bits check: Asserts that bits 4:2 are zero. Correct, but again, the reset polarity for arst_i isn't considered. Also, should check that these bits are always zero, not just when not in reset. The property as written doesn't cover all cases, only when not in reset. It should use 'always' to check in all cycles unless reset. Current property only checks when not in reset, but reserved bits should be zero even during operation. So the property is incomplete.

Busy flag synchronization: Uses start_cond and stop_cond sequences. The start_cond is SDA falling while SCL is high, which matches the spec. The property uses |-> ##[1:2] sr[6] throughout stop_cond. The 'throughout' ensures sr[6] stays high until stop_cond. However, the spec says Busy is set after START and cleared after STOP. The 'throughout' might not capture the exact moment when STOP occurs. Also, ##[1:2] assumes sr[6] is set within 1-2 cycles after START, but depending on internal logic, this might vary. It's a possible timing assumption not backed by the spec.

Arbitration lost detection: Checks when core drives SDA (sda_padoen_o low) but SDA input differs, and an unexpected STOP occurs. The spec mentions arbitration loss can happen if the core drives SDA high but it's low, or if a STOP is detected unexpectedly. The code combines these, which is good. However, the sequence uses ##0, which is immediate. But arbitration loss might take some time to propagate. Also, the code doesn't check if the core is actively driving (sda_padoen_o low) during a transfer. It might miss cases where arbitration is lost during other phases.

TIP lifecycle: Asserts that TIP is high when RD/WR is set and remains until transfer completes. The code uses |=> sr[1] throughout (cr[3] || cr[2])[->1] ##0 $fell(sr[1]). This seems to check that TIP stays high until the command bits are cleared. However, the spec says RD/WR bits are auto-cleared. The property might not correctly track the TIP duration relative to command execution. Also, using [->1] for goto might not capture the entire transfer duration.

Interrupt flag handling: Triggers on TIP fall or AL rise, and clears on IACK. The code uses 'until' which might not ensure the flag is cleared immediately when IACK is written. Also, the spec says IACK in the command register clears the interrupt. The code checks when writing to address 0x04 with cr[0] set, but needs to ensure that the write is successful (wb_ack_o). The property doesn't check for wb_ack_o, so it might fire on writes that aren't completed.

RxACK phase-aligned: Checks that after 8 SCL cycles, the RxACK bit matches SDA. The code uses ##8 (scl_pad_i && !sr[1]), assuming 8 cycles. However, the 9th SCL cycle is the ACK, so the count should be 9. Also, using $past(sda_pad_i,1) might not capture the correct cycle. The timing might be off by one.

Other issues: Missing default clocking, undefined signals (sda_padoen_o is used but not declared in the spec's signal list; in the spec, it's scl_padoen_o and sda_padoen_o). Also, the sequences start_cond and stop_cond are defined but not sure if SCL is high during the entire condition. The code doesn't check that SCL remains high during the START/STOP edges.

Clock cycle misinterpretations: Some properties use ##n delays which might not align with the actual clock cycles needed for the I2C operations, especially since the core uses an internal 5*SCL clock. The assertions might not synchronize correctly with the internal timing.

Nested conditions: Some properties have complex sequences with overlapping conditions, which could be simplified or broken down for clarity and correctness.

Completeness: Missed checking that IF is set when arbitration is lost (AL rises). The current iflag_comprehensive covers $rose(sr[5]), which is AL, so that's okay. But does it cover all cases where AL is set? Also, when a transfer completes (TIP falls), IF should set. The code covers $fell(sr[1]), which is TIP falling, so that's correct.

Consistency: All properties use disable iff with both resets, which is good. But the reset polarity might be an issue as discussed.

Creative thinking: The arbitration check combines SDA conflict and unexpected STOP, which is good. The RxACK uses a counter, which is a reasonable approach.

Score: Considering the flaws in reset handling, potential timing issues in ## delays, possible off-by-one in RxACK, and incomplete checks for reserved bits, I'd score this around 70/100. It covers most cases but has some critical timing and reset polarity issues.

**Critical Analysis of SVAs for Status Register (sr):**  
**Score: 65/100** (-35 for critical flaws)

---

### **1. Reset Handling Flaws (-15%)**
```systemverilog
// ❌ Incorrect reset polarity handling
disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)
```
- **Spec Violation:** Fails to account for `ARST_LVL` parameter (default active-low for `arst_i`).  
- **Impact:** Assertions may trigger during valid resets or miss real violations.  
- **Fix:**  
  ```systemverilog
  disable iff ((wb_rst_i) || (arst_i ^ ~ARST_LVL))
  ```

---

### **2. Wishbone Protocol Incompleteness (-10%)**
```systemverilog
##1 wb_ack_o |-> wb_dat_o == sr;  // ❌ Assumes fixed 2-cycle latency
```
- **Spec Gap:** Specification states "each access takes 2 clock cycles" but doesn't guarantee fixed latency.  
- **Impact:** Fails on designs with variable-latency Wishbone interfaces.  
- **Fix:** Use conservative interval:  
  ```systemverilog
  (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && ...) |-> ##[1:2] wb_ack_o ##0 (wb_dat_o == sr)
  ```

---

### **3. Reserved Bits Coverage Gap (-5%)**
```systemverilog
assert property (... (sr[4:2] == 3'b0));  // ❌ Only checks when not in reset
```
- **Missing Case:** Fails to verify reserved bits during normal operation.  
- **Impact:** Undetected corruption of reserved bits.  
- **Fix:**  
  ```systemverilog
  assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (sr[4:2] === 3'b0));
  ```

---

### **4. TIP Lifecycle Timing Issues (-15%)**
```systemverilog
(cr[3] || cr[2]) |=> sr[1] throughout ... // ❌ Ignores command auto-clear
```
- **Spec Misalignment:** Command bits (STA/STO/RD/WR) auto-clear per spec.  
- **Impact:** Fails to track TIP duration accurately.  
- **Fix:** Use SCL-based synchronization:  
  ```systemverilog
  $rose(sr[1]) |-> sr[1] throughout (scl_pad_i[->9]) ##0 !sr[1]
  ```

---

### **5. RxACK Phase Misalignment (-10%)**
```systemverilog
##8 (scl_pad_i && !sr[1])  // ❌ Off-by-one error (9th SCL cycle)
```
- **Spec Violation:** ACK occurs at 9th SCL cycle, not 8th.  
- **Impact:** Incorrect RxACK validation.  
- **Fix:**  
  ```systemverilog
  ##9 (scl_pad_i && !sr[1]) |-> ...
  ```

---

### **6. Arbitration Loss Oversights (-10%)**
```systemverilog
##0 (!cr[4] && stop_cond)  // ❌ Misses SCL conflicts
```
- **Spec Gap:** Arbitration loss can also occur during SCL conflicts.  
- **Impact:** Incomplete arbitration checks.  
- **Fix:** Add SCL conflict detection:  
  ```systemverilog
  (scl_pad_o != scl_pad_i) && !scl_padoen_o
  ```

---

### **7. Interrupt Flag Race Condition (-5%)**
```systemverilog
until (wb_we_i && ... cr[0])  // ❌ No ack validation
```
- **Protocol Risk:** Doesn't verify `wb_ack_o` for successful IACK writes.  
- **Impact:** False positives if writes fail.  
- **Fix:**  
  ```systemverilog
  until (wb_ack_o && wb_we_i && ...)
  ```

---

### **8. Signal Declaration Issues (-5%)**
- **Undefined Signals:** `sda_padoen_o`/`scl_padoen_o` not declared in spec's signal list.  
- **Impact:** Compilation errors.  
- **Fix:** Explicitly declare tri-state controls.

---

### **Recommendations for Improvement**
1. Add SCL frequency synchronization using `@(posedge scl_pad_i)`.  
2. Use cover properties for key protocol sequences (START/STOP).  
3. Formalize relationships between `sr` and command/transmit registers.  
4. Add assertions for multi-master clock stretching scenarios.  

**Conclusion:** While the SVAs cover core functionality, critical timing/reset issues and protocol gaps limit their reliability. Address reset polarity, Wishbone latency, and SCL synchronization for robust verification.
