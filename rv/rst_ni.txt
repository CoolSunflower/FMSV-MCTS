Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract all unique and valid assertions related to the signal rst_ni from the provided list. I need to make sure I include as many as possible without duplicates.

First, I'll go through each assertion one by one. The first one checks the width of rst_ni. That's important because the spec mentions that reset signals are usually a single bit. So "assert property (@(posedge clk_i) ($bits(rst_ni) == 1));" must be included. It's the only assertion regarding the signal's width, so if it's missing, I should add it, but here it's present.

Next, there's a property called rst_ni_intr_connectivity. It checks that when rst_ni is low, the interrupt is 0. That makes sense because during reset, interrupts should be disabled. So that's valid.

Then the rst_ni_mtime_connectivity assertion ensures mtime is zero when reset is active. According to the documentation, the timer should reset mtime to zero, so this is valid.

The rst_ni_tick_connectivity checks that tick is low during reset. Since the prescaler and step would be reset, tick shouldn't be active. The design details mention the tick generator uses prescaler values, so reset would stop it.

Looking at the various rst_ni_async_impact assertions, some seem similar. For example, one checks that when rst_ni falls, mtime is zero and intr is 0. Another does the same but adds mtime_d. I need to check if all these are unique. If they have different conditions, they should be kept. But if they're duplicates, only one should be kept. Wait, there are three different versions of rst_ni_async_impact. The first says mtime and intr, the third includes mtime_d and intr, and another mentions mtime_d and intr. Wait, the user said to keep unique ones. Let me list them:

1. "property rst_ni_async_impact;\n  @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> (mtime == 64'h0) and (intr == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (rst_ni_async_impact);"

2. "property rst_ni_async_impact;\n  @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> (intr == 0) and (mtime == 64'h0);\nendproperty\nassert property (rst_ni_async_impact);"

3. "property rst_ni_async_impact;\n  @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> (mtime_d == 64'h0) and (intr == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (rst_ni_async_impact);"

Wait, these are actually three different properties: the first two check mtime and intr, but the third checks mtime_d and intr. So these are different. However, the user lists them as separate entries, but maybe there's a typo. Let me check the user's list again. The user's list includes:

"property rst_ni_async_impact;\n  @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> (mtime == 64'h0) and (intr == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (rst_ni_async_impact);"

"property rst_ni_async_impact;\n  @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> (intr == 0) and (mtime == 64'h0);\nendproperty\nassert property (rst_ni_async_impact);"

These two are the same, just the order of conditions is swapped. So they are duplicates. Then another one checks mtime_d instead of mtime. So that's a different property, even though the name is the same. But in SystemVerilog, having multiple properties with the same name is not allowed, but perhaps in the user's list, they have different names? Wait, looking at the user's input:

The list includes:

...
"property rst_ni_async_impact;\n  @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> (intr == 0) and (mtime == 64'h0);\nendproperty\nassert property (rst_ni_async_impact);"
...
"property rst_ni_async_impact;\n  @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> (mtime_d == 64'h0) and (intr == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (rst_ni_async_impact);"
...

Wait, the names are the same, but the conditions differ. That's a problem because in SystemVerilog, you can't have two properties with the same name. So maybe this is a mistake in the user's input. However, the user provided them as separate entries. So perhaps the user intended them to be separate despite the same name, which could be an error, but the task is to extract as per the provided list.

But according to the problem statement, the user wants to extract all unique and valid assertions. So if two properties have the same code but different names, they would be considered unique. Wait, no. The problem is that the user's list may have multiple assertions with the same property name but different content. But in reality, that's invalid in SystemVerilog. However, the user may have made a mistake. But perhaps the user intended to have different properties but named them the same. For the purpose of this task, the user wants all unique assertions from the provided list, regardless of possible naming conflicts.

Alternatively, perhaps some of these are duplicates except for variables like mtime vs mtime_d. So, need to check each assertion's actual content.

Looking at the user's list:

Original assertion list includes:

1. rst_ni_async_impact (mtime and intr)
2. rst_ni_async_impact (intr and mtime)
3. rst_ni_async_impact (mtime_d and intr)
4. rst_ni_async_impact (mtime_d and intr) again?

Wait, let me count:

Looking at the user's list:

The entries are:

1. "property rst_ni_async_impact;\n  @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> (mtime == 64'h0) and (intr == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (rst_ni_async_impact);"

2. "property rst_ni_async_impact;\n  @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> (intr == 0) and (mtime == 64'h0);\nendproperty\nassert property (rst_ni_async_impact);"

These two are the same, just the order of conditions is reversed. Therefore, they are duplicates. So only one should be kept.

But the third one is:

"property rst_ni_async_impact;\n  @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> (mtime_d == 64'h0) and (intr == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (rst_ni_async_impact);"

This is a separate assertion checking mtime_d instead of mtime. So this is a different assertion and should be kept.

Another entry is:

"property rst_ni_async_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> (mtime == 64'h0) and (intr == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (rst_ni_async_reset);"

Same as the first, but property name is different. So this is a separate assertion. But the content is the same as the first. However, since the names are different, they are considered unique in the provided list, even though the code is the same. Wait, no. The user wants unique assertions. If two properties have different names but same code, they are considered duplicates? But the user says "unique and valid assertions". So uniqueness is determined by the code, not the name. So even if the property names differ, if the code is the same, they are duplicates.

For example, compare:

property A:
...
|-> (mtime ==0 and intr ==0)

property B:
...
|-> (intr ==0 and mtime ==0)

These are logically the same, so they are duplicates. Therefore, only one should be kept.

Similarly, if two properties have the same code but different names, but the same trigger conditions, they are duplicates. So need to check for that.

So for the list provided, the user's list includes:

Original list entries (simplified):

1. assertion 1: $bits(rst_ni) == 1

2. rst_ni_intr_connectivity: !rst_ni |-> intr ==0

3. rst_ni_mtime_connectivity: !rst_ni |-> mtime==0

4. rst_ni_tick_connectivity: !rst_ni |-> !tick

5. rst_ni_async_impact: $fell(rst_ni) |-> mtime==0 and intr==0

6. rst_ni_persistent_state: !rst_ni |-> mtime==0 throughout until rst_ni

7. post_reset_operation: $rose(rst_ni) |=> !$stable(mtime)

8. rst_ni_async_impact: $fell(rst_ni) |-> intr==0 and mtime==0 (same as 5)

9. rst_ni_signal_persistence: !rst_ni throughout until $rose(rst_ni) |-> (intr==0, mtime==0, !tick)

10. rst_ni_mtime_d_connectivity: !rst_ni |-> mtime_d==0

11. rst_ni_async_impact: $fell(rst_ni) |-> mtime_d==0 and intr==0

12. rst_ni_override_active: !rst_ni && active |-> mtime_d==0

13. rst_ni_prescaler_reset: !rst_ni |=> stable(tick)[*3]

14. rst_ni_async_reset: $fell(rst_ni) |-> mtime==0 and intr==0 (same as 5 and 8)

15. rst_ni_persistence: !rst_ni throughout until rst_ni |-> mtime==0

Now, process each:

1. Keep assertion 1 as it's the width check.

2. Keep assertion 2: intr connectivity.

3. Keep assertion 3: mtime connectivity.

4. Keep assertion 4: tick connectivity.

5. Keep assertion 5: async_impact (fell -> mtime and intr).

6. Keep assertion 6: persistent_state.

7. Keep assertion7: post_reset_operation.

8. assertion8 is duplicate of 5, so discard.

9. Keep assertion9: signal_persistence.

10. Keep assertion10: mtime_d connectivity.

11. Keep assertion11: async_impact with mtime_d and intr.

12. Keep assertion12: override_active.

13. Keep assertion13: prescaler_reset.

14. assertion14 is same as5 and8, so discard.

15. assertion15: persistence (similar to assertion6 but slightly different? Need to check.

Wait, assertion6 says:

property rst_ni_persistent_state;
  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> mtime == 64'h0 throughout (##[0:$] rst_ni);
endproperty

assertion15 says:

property rst_ni_persistence;
  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni throughout (##[0:$] rst_ni) |-> (mtime == 64'h0);
endproperty

So assertion6 is: when !rst_ni, mtime remains 0 until rst_ni is asserted again.

assertion15: when !rst_ni throughout until rst_ni, then mtime is 0. So these are similar but not exactly the same. The 'throughout' is placed differently. So they are different. Therefore, both should be kept.

Other assertions:

assertion7 is about after reset, mtime starts changing. So valid.

assertion9 checks that during reset, till reset is released, the intr, mtime, and tick are 0. Combines multiple signals. Valid.

assertion10: mtime_d is another signal, so needs to be kept.

assertion11: similar to async_impact but checks mtime_d. Valid.

assertion12: checks if active is high and rst_ni is low, mtime_d is 0. Valid.

assertion13: after reset, tick is stable for 3 cycles.

Now, check if all unique.

Now, from the original user's list, the provided assertions are:

After removing exact duplicates (same code even if name differs), but considering that different code (e.g., mtime vs mtime_d) are unique.

So the unique assertions are:

1. Width check: yes.

Assertions related to rst_ni's impact:

- intr_connectivity: when rst_ni is low, intr is 0.

- mtime_connectivity: when rst_ni is low, mtime is 0.

- tick_connectivity: when rst_ni is low, tick is low.

- async_impact (fell -> mtime and intr 0).

- async_impact (fell -> mtime_d and intr 0).

- persistent_state: !rst_ni |-> mtime stays 0 until rst_ni.

- signal_persistence: during reset, until release, intr, mtime, tick are 0.

- mtime_d_connectivity: when rst_ni low, mtime_d 0.

- override_active: when rst_ni and active, mtime_d 0.

- prescaler_reset: after reset, tick is stable for 3 cycles.

- async_reset (same as async_impact with mtime, so duplicate).

But async_reset's code is same as the first async_impact, but named differently. So if code is same, even if name differs, they're duplicates. So if there's an assertion with same code but different name, like rst_ni_async_reset, but the code is same as rst_ni_async_impact (mtime and intr), then they are duplicates and only one should be kept. But in the user's list, the following exists:

"property rst_ni_async_reset;\n  @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> (mtime == 64'h0) and (intr == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (rst_ni_async_reset);"

This is the same as the first async_impact property. So these are duplicates and only one should be kept.

Similarly, the property named rst_ni_async_impact but checking mtime_d is a different assertion, so it's kept.

So, after removing duplicates where the code is the same, here's the list:

Original assertions after removing code duplicates:

1. Width check.

2. intr_connectivity.

3. mtime_connectivity.

4. tick_connectivity.

5. async_impact (fell -> mtime & intr).

6. persistent_state.

7. post_reset_operation.

8. signal_persistence.

9. mtime_d_connectivity.

10. async_impact (fell -> mtime_d & intr).

11. override_active.

12. prescaler_reset.

13. persistence (similar to persistent_state but different structure).

14. async_reset (duplicate of 5, so removed).

So the final unique assertions are the ones listed above except duplicates.

Wait, but need to check each one.

The user's list has 15 entries. Let me go through each of them as per the user's list.

Original list entries (numbering as per user's list):

1. assert property (@(posedge clk_i) ($bits(rst_ni) == 1)); → valid, keep.

2. property rst_ni_intr_connectivity: !rst_ni |-> intr==0. Valid, keep.

3. property rst_ni_mtime_connectivity: !rst_ni |-> mtime==0. Keep.

4. property rst_ni_tick_connectivity: !rst_ni |-> !tick. Keep.

5. property rst_ni_async_impact: fell(rst_ni) → mtime==0 & intr==0. Keep.

6. property rst_ni_persistent_state: !rst_ni → mtime==0 throughout until rst_ni. Keep.

7. property post_reset_operation: rose(rst_ni) |=> mtime changes. Keep.

8. property rst_ni_async_impact: same as 5 but condition order swapped. Duplicate, discard.

9. property rst_ni_signal_persistence: !rst_ni throughout until rose → (intr, mtime, tick) ==0. Keep.

10. property rst_ni_mtime_d_connectivity: !rst_ni → mtime_d==0. Keep.

11. property rst_ni_async_impact (mtime_d & intr). Keep.

12. property rst_ni_override_active: !rst_ni && active → mtime_d==0. Keep.

13. property rst_ni_prescaler_reset: !rst_ni |=> stable(tick) for 3 cycles. Keep.

14. property rst_ni_async_reset: same as 5. Duplicate, discard.

15. property rst_ni_persistence: similar to 6 but structure different. Keep.

Wait, number 15 is:

property rst_ni_persistence:
  @(posedge clk_i)
  !rst_ni throughout (##[0:$] rst_ni) |-> (mtime == 64'h0);
endproperty
assert property (rst_ni_persistence);

This says that if rst_ni is low throughout until it rises, then mtime should be 0. So it's similar to assertion6, which is:

property rst_ni_persistent_state:
  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> mtime == 64'h0 throughout (##[0:$] rst_ni);
endproperty

So assertion6 says "when !rst_ni is true, then mtime must be 0 throughout until rst_ni is asserted".

Assertion15 says "if !rst_ni is true throughout until rst_ni is asserted, then mtime must be 0."

They have similar intent but different structure. So both assertions are checking that during reset, mtime remains 0 until reset is released. So these might overlap, but they are different properties. Hence, both should be kept.

So now, compiling all unique assertions:

1. Width check.

2. intr_connectivity.

3. mtime_connectivity.

4. tick_connectivity.

5. async_impact (fell → mtime & intr).

6. persistent_state.

7. post_reset_operation.

9. signal_persistence.

10. mtime_d_connectivity.

11. async_impact with mtime_d.

12. override_active.

13. prescaler_reset.

15. persistence.

Also, check if the user's list includes any other assertions.

Now, the user's list has 15 entries. After processing:

Entries 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,15 are unique.

Additionally, is there an assertion missing for the width? The first one is present, so no.

So the final list should include all these.

The user says "Ensure that the assertions for width of current signal is always present, add that assertion if missing." Since assertion1 is present, we include it.

Now, check if all these assertions are valid based on the documentation.

The documentation says:

- The timer has mtime and mtimecmp registers, which are 64-bit. Upon reset, these should be cleared. Also, the timer's counter increments based on prescaler and step.

So the assertions regarding mtime being 0 during reset are valid.

Intr (interrupt) should be 0 during reset.

The tick signal comes from the prescaler, which is reset, so tick should be 0 during reset.

mtime_d could be an internal register for mtime, so during reset, it should be 0.

The prescaler reset assertion says that after reset, tick remains stable for 3 cycles. Is this valid? The documentation says that after reset, the prescaler would start counting from 0. So after reset, the tick may start generating after prescaler steps. The assertion checks that after !rst_ni, the tick remains stable for 3 cycles. This depends on the design. If the prescaler is reset, then the internal counter is 0, so the tick would not occur until the prescaler value is reached. So during reset, tick is 0, then after reset, the prescaler starts counting. So if the prescaler is 0, it would tick on the first cycle. However, this might depend on design specifics. The documentation says the prescaler is set by firmware, but the reset value is not specified. Assuming that after reset, prescaler is 0, but maybe the assertion is checking that during reset, the tick stays low. However, the user's assertion says:

property rst_ni_prescaler_reset:
  @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |=> $stable(tick)[*3];
endproperty
assert property (rst_ni_prescaler_reset);

This means that after reset is active (!rst_ni), in the next cycle, tick remains stable for 3 cycles. The '|=>' means that in the next cycle, tick remains the same for three consecutive cycles. If during reset, the prescaler is not active, then tick would stay low. But in the design, after reset, the prescaler starts incrementing. However, during reset (rst_ni low), the prescaler module may be held in reset, so the tick stays low. Once reset is released, the prescaler can start counting. So this assertion may be checking that during reset, the tick doesn't change. However, the property is triggered when !rst_ni is active, then in the next cycle (since it's |=>), it checks that tick is stable for three cycles. But during reset, the tick should be 0, and after reset is released, the tick may start toggling. So this assertion may be invalid if the prescaler is enabled after reset. However, the user's timer documentation states that in this version, the timer only supports a single fixed clock, and the firmware should set the prescaler appropriately. But during reset, the prescaler's configuration registers may be reset, leading to a default value, which may be 0. If the prescaler is 0, then the tick would generate on every clock cycle. But during reset, the prescaler's counter would be reset, so the tick would not occur. Wait, the tick is generated when the prescaler's internal counter reaches the prescaler value. If during reset, the prescaler's internal counter is reset to 0, and the prescaler value is also 0 (if not set by firmware), then the tick would trigger immediately after reset. But since during reset, the prescaler is not counting, perhaps? So the assertion may be valid. This requires deeper understanding, but given that the user wants to retain all possible valid assertions, and the question is to extract from the given list, we include it.

Now, to sum up, the unique assertions related to rst_ni from the list, ensuring maximum retention, and including the width check, are:

1. Width check.
2. intr_connectivity.
3. mtime_connectivity.
4. tick_connectivity.
5. async_impact (mtime and intr).
6. persistent_state.
7. post_reset_operation.
9. signal_persistence (intr, mtime, tick).
10. mtime_d_connectivity.
11. async_impact (mtime_d and intr).
12. override_active.
13. prescaler_reset.
15. persistence.

Plus, there's another async_reset (entry14) which was a duplicate of async_impact and was removed.

Additionally, need to ensure that the width check is present. It is, as assertion1.

So now, list all the unique assertions in the user's original list, after removing duplicates based on code (not name):

1. assert property (@(posedge clk_i) ($bits(rst_ni) == 1));

2. property rst_ni_intr_connectivity:
   @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (intr == 0);
   endproperty

3. property rst_ni_mtime_connectivity:
   @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (mtime == 64'h0);
   endproperty

4. property rst_ni_tick_connectivity:
   @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> !tick;
   endproperty

5. property rst_ni_async_impact:
   @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> (mtime == 64'h0) and (intr == 0);
   endproperty

6. property rst_ni_persistent_state:
   @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> mtime == 64'h0 throughout (##[0:$] rst_ni);
   endproperty

7. property post_reset_operation:
   @(posedge clk_i) $rose(rst_ni) |=> !$stable(mtime);
   endproperty

8. property rst_ni_signal_persistence:
   @(posedge clk_i)
   !rst_ni throughout (##[0:$] $rose(rst_ni)) |->
     (intr == 0) and (mtime == 64'h0) and (!tick);
   endproperty

9. property rst_ni_mtime_d_connectivity:
   @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |-> (mtime_d == 64'h0);
   endproperty

10. property rst_ni_async_impact (different one with mtime_d):
    @(posedge clk_i) $fell(rst_ni) |-> (mtime_d == 64'h0) and (intr == 0);
    endproperty

11. property rst_ni_override_active:
    @(posedge clk_i) (!rst_ni && active) |-> (mtime_d == 64'h0);
    endproperty

12. property rst_ni_prescaler_reset:
    @(posedge clk_i) !rst_ni |=> $stable(tick)[*3];
    endproperty

13. property rst_ni_persistence:
    @(posedge clk_i)
    !rst_ni throughout (##[0:$] rst_ni) |-> (mtime == 64'h0);
    endproperty

So all these are unique and valid. Now, check the original user's list to ensure none are missed.

The user's list also includes:

Another entry: property rst_ni_async_impact (the one with mtime_d ==0 and intr ==0), which is included as number 10 above.

Thus, all unique assertions from the user's list related to rst_ni are included.
