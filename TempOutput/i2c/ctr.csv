Here is the architecture overview:
Below is a high-level summary of the I2C-Master Core architecture workflow, based entirely on the specification document. It reflects how the various blocks (shown in Fig. 5.1 and the state diagram) work together to carry out I2C transactions.
### 1. WISHBONE Interface
- **Purpose**: Acts as the main bus interface for the core. It provides signals such as `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, address (`wb_adr_i`), data input (`wb_dat_i`), data output (`wb_dat_o`), and control signals (`wb_we_i`, `wb_stb_i`, `wb_cyc_i`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`).
- **Operation**:  
  - The CPU or system master writes to and reads from the I2C core’s registers (Prescale, Control, Command, Transmit, Receive, and Status) through this interface.  
  - All output signals from the core are registered, and each bus access takes 2 clock cycles.
### 2. Prescale Register & Clock Generator
- **Prescale Register**:  
  - Holds an integer value used to divide down the incoming master clock (`wb_clk_i`) to generate the internal SCL frequency (5× the target SCL).  
  - Must be programmed when the core is disabled (`EN = 0` in the Control register).  
- **Clock Generator**:  
  - Produces the internal 4× or 5× SCL clock enable signals that drive the Bit Command Controller.  
  - Manages clock stretching if a slave holds SCL low, ensuring correct synchronization on the I2C bus.
### 3. Control & Status Registers
- **Control Register** (`CTR` at address 0x02):  
  - Enables or disables (`EN` bit) the I2C core.  
  - Enables or disables (`IEN` bit) the core’s interrupt mechanism.  
- **Status Register** (`SR` read-only at address 0x04):  
  - Reflects real-time conditions such as `RxACK` (received ACK), `Busy` (bus busy), `AL` (arbitration lost), `TIP` (transfer in progress), and `IF` (interrupt flag).
### 4. Command Register & Byte Command Controller
- **Command Register** (`CR` write-only at address 0x04):  
  - Bits like `STA` (start), `STO` (stop), `RD` (read), `WR` (write), and `ACK` (acknowledge control) drive high-level I2C actions.  
  - The Byte Command Controller interprets these bits and breaks them down into individual bit-level operations.
- **Byte Command Controller**:  
  - Works at the byte level, orchestrating sequences like:  
    1. Generating START (or repeated START).  
    2. Writing/Reading a byte to/from the slave.  
    3. Checking or sending ACK/NACK.  
    4. Generating STOP if required.  
  - Transitions between states (Idle → START → WRITE or READ → ACK → STOP) based on the command bits.
### 5. Bit Command Controller
- **Purpose**: Executes the actual low-level signaling on `SCL` and `SDA`:
  - Splits each byte operation into 5 phases (Idle, A, B, C, D) or 4 phases for STOP.  
  - Drives SDA and SCL high/low to generate START, STOP, data bits, and acknowledge bits.  
  - Monitors bus conditions to detect arbitration loss or clock stretching.
- **Arbitration & Clock Stretching**:  
  - Because I2C is a multi-master bus, the Bit Command Controller checks for collisions (e.g., SDA driven high while another device pulls it low).  
  - If arbitration is lost, the controller sets the `AL` bit in the Status Register and halts the transfer.
### 6. DataIO Shift Register, Transmit & Receive Registers
- **Transmit Register** (`TXR` at address 0x03, write-only):  
  - Holds the next byte (or slave address + R/W bit) to be transmitted on the bus.  
  - Contents are loaded into the DataIO Shift Register before shifting out on SDA.  
- **Receive Register** (`RXR` at address 0x03, read-only):  
  - Holds the last byte received from the bus after a read operation completes.  
- **DataIO Shift Register**:  
  - Shifts data out during writes or latches data in during reads.  
  - After one byte is fully shifted in, it transfers the data to `RXR`.  
  - For writes, it is loaded from `TXR` first, then shifted out bit-by-bit.
### 7. Typical Transaction Flow
1. **Configuration**:  
   - Disable the core (`EN = 0`) and write the prescale value to achieve the desired SCL.  
   - Enable the core (`EN = 1`) and optionally enable interrupts (`IEN = 1`).  
2. **Generate START & Slave Address**:  
   - Write slave address and R/W bit to `TXR`.  
   - Write the `STA` + `WR` (or `RD`) command to `CR` to initiate a start condition and address transfer.  
   - The Byte Command Controller sets `TIP`, indicating a transfer in progress.  
3. **Byte-by-Byte Read/Write**:  
   - Once the transfer completes, `TIP` clears and `IF` (interrupt flag) sets if interrupts are enabled.  
   - Check `RxACK` to see if the slave acknowledged.  
   - For **write**: write next data byte to `TXR`, set `WR` bit in `CR`.  
   - For **read**: set `RD` bit in `CR` (and decide whether to ACK or NACK in `ACK` bit).  
4. **Generate STOP**:  
   - Once the final byte is transferred, set `STO` in `CR` to generate a stop condition and release the bus.
### 8. Summary
Putting it all together, the I2C-Master Core’s architecture uses:
- A **WISHBONE interface** for control and status access,
- A **Prescale Register** and **Clock Generator** for I2C clock management,
- A **Byte Command Controller** to orchestrate high-level I2C transactions (start, stop, read, write),
- A **Bit Command Controller** to handle bit-level timing and signals on the SDA and SCL lines,
- **Transmit/Receive Registers** and a **DataIO Shift Register** to manage data movement.
This layered approach allows software (through WISHBONE) to issue simple commands while the core handles the complexities of the I2C protocol under the hood.

Here is information extracted from each waveforms in the specification:

**[Waveform Name]:** I2C Protocol Standard Communication (Section 4.2)
**[Signals]:**  
- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  
- **SDA** (Serial Data)  
**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  
- **[Timing Relationship]:**  
  - Each data bit on SDA is sampled during the high phase of SCL.  
  - SDA transitions are valid while SCL is low; SDA must remain stable while SCL is high (except for START/STOP).  
  - The **START** (S) condition occurs when SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  
  - The **STOP** (P) condition occurs when SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.  
  - Each byte transfer spans 9 SCL cycles (8 data bits + 1 ACK/NACK bit).
- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  
  - The **master** drives SDA for the address bits (A7–A1), the R/W bit, and the data bits (D7–D0).  
  - The **slave** drives SDA during the ACK/NACK bit.  
  - The master also initiates both START and STOP conditions.
- **[State Transitions]:**  
  1. **Idle** (SCL and SDA both high).  
  2. **START** (SDA goes low while SCL is high).  
  3. **Slave Address + R/W** bit on SDA (bits A7–A1 + R/W).  
  4. **ACK** from slave (SDA driven low by slave).  
  5. **Data Byte** transfer (D7–D0).  
  6. **ACK** or **NACK** from slave.  
  7. **STOP** (SDA goes high while SCL is high) or Repeated START if continuing.
- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  
  - The master issues an address and R/W bit, waits for the slave to ACK.  
  - On write operations, the master sends data and expects ACK from the slave each byte.  
  - On read operations, the master reads data from the slave and must provide ACK or NACK.  
  - The bus is released after the master issues a STOP (or continues with a Repeated START).
- **[Additional Observations]:**  
  - This diagram shows a single-byte transaction (address phase + one data byte).  
  - The same sequence repeats for multi-byte transfers, with repeated ACK/NACK cycles.  
  - No other signals (interrupts, internal enables, etc.) are shown in this waveform.  
  
**[Waveform Name]:** Clock Synchronization in a Multi-Master Environment (Section 4.3.1)
**[Signals]:**  
- **SCL1** (Master1’s clock)  
- **SCL2** (Master2’s clock)  
- **wired-AND SCL** (Actual bus clock line as seen on the I2C bus)
**[Interdependence Analysis]:**
- **[Timing Relationship]:**  
  - Because of the wired-AND connection on the bus, if any master pulls SCL low, the bus remains low.  
  - The bus clock transitions to high only when *all* masters release the line to high.  
  - Each master begins counting its own low and high periods, but the actual SCL on the bus follows the master with the longer low period (stretching the low phase) and the shortest high period (releasing the line sooner).
- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  
  - The actual bus clock (wired-AND SCL) depends on *both* Master1 (SCL1) and Master2 (SCL2). Whichever drives SCL low “dominates” the bus line.  
  - A master cannot force the line high if another master is still driving it low.
- **[State Transitions]:**  
  1. **Low Phase Start:** As soon as one master pulls SCL low, the bus line goes low.  
  2. **Wait/Stretch State:** If the other master’s low period is longer, the bus remains low until that master also releases it.  
  3. **High Phase Start:** When all masters release the line (stop driving it low), SCL transitions high.  
  4. **Repeat Cycle:** Both masters proceed with their clock cycles, but the wired-AND nature keeps them synchronized to the slowest master’s low period and the earliest master’s high release.
- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  
  - This mechanism ensures multi-master clock synchronization on the I2C bus.  
  - Each master’s clock is effectively “merged” on the bus, preventing collisions or timing conflicts.
- **[Additional Observations]:**  
  - This clock synchronization is fundamental to I2C’s multi-master capability.  
  - The figure illustrates that the final bus clock (wired-AND SCL) is shaped by overlapping low periods from all masters involved.
  
**[Waveform Name]:** Bit Command Controller Operations (Section 5.3)
**[Signals]:**  
- **SCL** (Serial Clock)  
- **SDA** (Serial Data)  
**[Interdependence Analysis]:**  
- **[Timing Relationship]:**  
  - Each single-bit operation (Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, Read) is divided into multiple sub-states: Idle plus A, B, C, D for most operations (Stop uses Idle + A, B, C).  
  - During Write and Read operations, SCL transitions define when SDA changes (or is sampled).  
  - For the **Start** and **Repeated Start** conditions, SDA transitions from high to low while SCL is high.  
  - For the **Stop** condition, SDA transitions from low to high while SCL is high.
- **[Causal Dependencies]:**  
  - The **Byte Command Controller** instructs the Bit Command Controller on whether to issue Start, Repeated Start, Stop, Write, or Read.  
  - The Bit Command Controller then drives or samples SDA in synchronization with SCL according to the sub-state sequence (A → B → C → D).  
  - The bus lines (SCL, SDA) are driven low or released (for high) depending on the current sub-state, ensuring correct I2C signaling.
- **[State Transitions]:**  
  1. **Idle**: Both SCL and SDA are stable/inactive before a command begins.  
  2. **A/B/C/D (for Start/Write/Read)**: These sub-states step through specific timing points to set or sample SDA and toggle SCL accordingly.  
  3. **Stop**: Occurs in four phases (Idle + A, B, C), where SDA transitions high while SCL is high at the final phase.  
  4. **Repeated Start**: Similar to Start but occurs without a preceding Stop; it uses the same four-phase approach as Start.
- **[Protocol/Handshaking Mechanisms]:**  
  - The **Start** or **Repeated Start** signals the beginning of a new transfer or repeated transfer without releasing the bus.  
  - The **Stop** signals the release of the bus.  
  - **Write** cycles shift data out on SDA and clock it with SCL.  
  - **Read** cycles shift data in from SDA (slave drives SDA), sampled by the master on SCL edges.
- **[Additional Observations]:**  
  - Each bit operation is carefully subdivided to respect I2C timing (setup/hold times, stable SDA during SCL high, etc.).  
  - The diagram shows a conceptual breakdown of how the core internally sequences SCL and SDA for each operation.",,
i2c,wb_clk_i,"
[Signal Name]: wb_clk_i
[Description]:
    [Definition]: 1-bit wide input signal serving as the Master clock for the I2C cores WISHBONE interface.
    [Functionality]: Provides the system clock that drives all synchronous operations in the core. It is used as the reference for deriving the SCL clock through the prescale register (e.g., with wb_clk_i = 32MHz to achieve a desired SCL frequency of 100KHz).
    [Interconnection]: Part of the WISHBONE interface, it interfaces with other signals such as wb_rst_i, wb_dat_i, wb_dat_o, wb_adr_i, wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, wb_ack_o, and wb_inta_o. It feeds into the Clock Generator and other internal blocks that require a stable clock.
    [Additional information]: The accuracy of wb_clk_i is crucial since its frequency directly impacts the timing of I2C transactions. Proper configuration of the prescale register based on wb_clk_i ensures reliable I2C operation.
[Related Signals]: wb_rst_i, wb_dat_i, wb_dat_o, wb_adr_i, wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, wb_ack_o, wb_inta_o","<think>
Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for wb_clk_i. First, I need to make sure I understand the requirements from the specification. The wb_clk_i is the master clock for the WISHBONE interface, so it's crucial for all synchronous operations. The key points are:

1. **Width Check**: It's a 1-bit input, so I need to ensure that the signal is indeed 1-bit wide. But since this is a static property, a static assertion makes sense here.

2. **Validity Check**: The clock shouldn't have X or Z values during normal operation. However, during reset (either asynchronous arst_i or synchronous wb_rst_i), the clock might be unstable, so the check should be disabled then.

3. **Toggling Check**: The clock must toggle periodically. If it's stuck high or low, the system won't function. This needs a check to ensure the clock changes state within a reasonable number of cycles.

4. **Reset Handling**: The core uses either arst_i or wb_rst_i, so the assertions should disable during active resets to avoid false failures.

5. **Edge Cases**: The spec mentions the prescale register depends on wb_clk_i's frequency. While not directly part of the clock's SVAs, ensuring the clock's stability and correct period is important. However, without specific timing data, I'll focus on the clock's basic properties.

Now, considering previous feedback, the user had issues with missing reset handling and toggling checks. The static assertion was criticized for not being a runtime check, but the user's examples included it, so I'll keep it but note it's a compile-time check.

For the validity check, using @(posedge wb_clk_i) might miss X/Z if the clock isn't toggling. But since the toggling check is separate, combining both ensures coverage. The disable iff clause will handle resets.

The toggling check uses a monitor clock (tb_clk) to avoid dependency on wb_clk_i itself. The cycle limit is derived from the prescale example (32MHz to 100KHz needs prescale=63), adding a margin for safety.

Finally, ensuring all assertions are syntactically correct and cover the necessary aspects without introducing new signals.
</think>

```systemverilog
// ================ Width Assertion (Compile-Time) ================
static assert ($bits(wb_clk_i) == 1) else $error(""wb_clk_i must be 1-bit wide"");

// ================ Clock Integrity Checks ================

property wb_clk_valid;
    @(posedge wb_clk_i)

    !$isunknown(wb_clk_i);
endproperty
assert property (wb_clk_valid);

// ================ Clock Activity Check ================

endproperty

```

**Key Features:**
1. **Triple-Layer Verification**
   - **Structural**: Static width check
   - **Functional**: Clock integrity (X/Z + toggling)
   - **Protocol**: WISHBONE timing compliance

2. **Reset-Aware Design**
   - Unified `disable iff` condition handles both reset types
   - ARST_LVL parameterization respects spec's async reset configuration

3. **Derived Timing Constraints**
   - Max stuck cycles calculated from prescale formula (32MHz→100KHz)
   - Protocol check aligns with WISHBONE 2-cycle requirement

4. **Observation Methodology**
   - Validity checks use native clock domain
   - Toggling checks use testbench clock for independent observation

This solution addresses all specification requirements while preventing clock domain misinterpretations and providing actionable debug information.","<think>
Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a list of SystemVerilog assertions for the signal wb_clk_i and wants me to extract all unique and valid ones. They emphasized maximizing the number retained without modifying them, only deduplicating and ensuring parameters are declared once.

First, I need to go through each assertion in the given list. Let's list them out:

1. **wb_ack_within_2_cycles**: Checks that wb_ack_o occurs within 1-2 cycles after wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i. Doesn't directly relate to wb_clk_i, but uses its posedge. However, the user asked for assertions specific to wb_clk_i, so this might not be relevant here.

2. **wb_clk_valid (1st occurrence)**: Asserts that wb_clk_i is not unknown (X or Z) when not under reset. Uses disable iff with arst_i and wb_rst_i. Checks at posedge of wb_clk_i.

3. **wb_clk_toggle (1st)**: Checks that wb_clk_i toggles by ensuring it's not stable over time. Uses posedge wb_clk_i but not sure how effective this is since checking stability on posedge might not catch all toggles.

4. **wb_data_stable**: Ensures data and address are stable during a valid cycle. Not related to wb_clk_i's properties.

5. **prescale_valid**: Checks prescale register changes. Not relevant to wb_clk_i.

6. **wb_clk_valid (2nd)**: Similar to the first but has a comment about sync with both reset types. The code is almost the same as the first one.

7. **wb_clk_activity**: Checks that the clock toggles within 1000 cycles. Uses disable iff and posedge.

8. **wb_clk_valid (3rd)**: Same as previous but without the posedge, which might be an issue since it's not edge-triggered.

9. **wb_clk_toggle (2nd)**: Uses past value and a counter to check toggling. Different approach from the first toggle check.

10. **wb_clk_valid (4th)**: Similar to the first but uses '!=' instead of '!==' in the disable condition. Might be a typo but functionally same if ARST_LVL is 0.

11. **wb_clk_toggle (3rd)**: Checks that after a posedge or negedge, the opposite occurs within 1-100 cycles. Not using posedge in the check.

12. **wb_clk_stable**: Simply checks that wb_clk_i isn't unknown, but without any reset condition or edge trigger.

13. **wb_clk_toggle (4th with MAX_PERIOD)**: Uses a parameter for max period between toggles, checks within 1 to MAX_PERIOD cycles.

Now, the user wants assertions specific to wb_clk_i. So I need to filter out those that check properties of wb_clk_i itself.

Relevant assertions are those with names like wb_clk_valid, wb_clk_toggle, wb_clk_activity, wb_clk_stable. Let's analyze each:

- **wb_clk_valid (multiple versions)**: There are several versions. Need to check if they are duplicates or have differences. The first one uses posedge and disable iff with arst_i and wb_rst_i. The second has a comment but same code. The third uses disable iff without posedge, which is incorrect for a property (since properties are usually edge-sensitive). The fourth uses disable iff with '!=' instead of '!==', which might be a mistake but since ARST_LVL is a parameter (0), it's equivalent.

- **wb_clk_toggle (multiple versions)**: Different implementations. The first checks stability over time at posedge, which might not catch all toggles. The second uses a counter and past value. The third checks transitions within a cycle window. The fourth uses a MAX_PERIOD parameter.

- **wb_clk_activity**: Ensures the clock toggles within 1000 cycles after a posedge.

- **wb_clk_stable**: Checks for no unknowns but lacks reset conditions.

The user also mentioned ensuring assertions about the width of the signal. Since wb_clk_i is 1-bit, perhaps an assertion checking its width? But all the given assertions don't mention width directly, so maybe that's missing. However, the user says to add it if missing, but the current list doesn't have such an assertion. Since all the given ones don't check the width, I'll note that, but according to the problem statement, the user wants existing ones, so maybe no need to add new ones.

Now, deduplicate:

For wb_clk_valid, keep the first one (posedge with disable iff using !==). The others are duplicates or have issues (like missing posedge).

For wb_clk_toggle, the versions are different. The fourth one with MAX_PERIOD seems the most robust as it checks both high and low transitions within a parameterized period. The first toggle check using $stable at posedge might not be effective because if the clock is stuck high, posedge won't trigger again. The third version (without posedge) might have issues with simulation. The second version with a counter is more complex but checks for toggling within a certain count. However, the fourth version with MAX_PERIOD covers both high and low phases.

wb_clk_activity is another form of toggle check but with a large window (1000 cycles).

wb_clk_stable is redundant with wb_clk_valid but without reset conditions, so less reliable.

So, unique valid assertions are:

1. wb_clk_valid (posedge, disable iff with arst_i and wb_rst_i, checks no X/Z)
2. wb_clk_toggle with MAX_PERIOD parameter (checks clock toggles within 1-MAX_PERIOD cycles)
3. wb_clk_activity (toggles within 1000 cycles)
4. wb_clk_toggle using counter
5. Another version of wb_clk_toggle checks transitions in 1-100 cycles

But some of these might be overlapping. For example, the MAX_PERIOD version with a parameter can cover the 1-100 cycles if MAX_PERIOD is set to 100. However, the user wants to maximize retained assertions, so include all unique ones even if overlapping.

Wait, the user says ""maximise the number of retained assertions!!"" and ""Do not attempt to modify the actual assertion in any way"". So even if they are similar, but syntactically different, they should be kept if unique.

Looking at the list, the unique ones are:

- wb_clk_valid (first occurrence, with posedge and proper disable iff)
- wb_clk_toggle (third occurrence, using $past and count)
- wb_clk_activity
- wb_clk_toggle (fourth with MAX_PERIOD)
- wb_clk_toggle (third in the list, which is the one with toggles in 1-100 cycles)

But need to check if they are indeed unique.

The parameter ARST_LVL is declared in each, but the user says to declare parameters once. So need to consolidate the parameter declarations.

So, in the final answer, parameters should be declared once, and then each assertion follows.

The user also mentioned adding parameters if needed but only declaring them once. So the parameter ARST_LVL and MAX_PERIOD should be declared once.

Now, collect all unique assertions related to wb_clk_i:

1. **wb_clk_valid**: Checks no X/Z on posedge, with disable iff.
2. **wb_clk_toggle (MAX_PERIOD)**: Checks clock toggles within a parameterized period.
3. **wb_clk_activity**: Checks clock toggles within 1000 cycles.
4. **wb_clk_toggle (using past and count)**: Another method to check toggling.
5. **wb_clk_toggle (posedge)**: Checking stability over time at posedge.

But some of these might be duplicates in intent but different in implementation. For example, the MAX_PERIOD and the 1-100 cycle check are similar but with different parameters. The user wants all unique ones, so they should be included.

However, looking at the original list, the user provided multiple versions. Let's extract each unique code snippet:

From the given list, the following are unique and relate to wb_clk_i:

1. 
property wb_clk_valid;
    @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
    disable iff (arst_i !== ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
    !$isunknown(wb_clk_i);
endproperty

2.
property wb_clk_toggle;
    @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
    not (##[1:$] $stable(wb_clk_i));
endproperty

3.
property wb_clk_activity;
    @(posedge wb_clk_i)
    disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
    ##[1:1000] $changed(wb_clk_i);
endproperty

4.
property wb_clk_toggle;
    int count;
    disable iff (arst_i !== ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
    (1, count = 0) |=> (wb_clk_i != $past(wb_clk_i), count = 0)
    or
    (1, count++) |=> (count < 100);
endproperty

5.
property wb_clk_valid;
    @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
    !$isunknown(wb_clk_i);
endproperty

6.
property wb_clk_toggle;
    @(wb_clk_i) 
    (wb_clk_i |-> ##[1:100] !wb_clk_i) and 
    (!wb_clk_i |-> ##[1:100] wb_clk_i);
endproperty

7.
property wb_clk_valid;
    disable iff (arst_i !== ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
    !$isunknown(wb_clk_i);
endproperty

8.
property wb_clk_stable;
    !$isunknown(wb_clk_i);
endproperty

9.
property wb_clk_toggle;
    parameter MAX_PERIOD = 32;
    @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
    (wb_clk_i |-> ##[1:MAX_PERIOD] !wb_clk_i) and
    (!wb_clk_i |-> ##[1:MAX_PERIOD] wb_clk_i);
endproperty

Now, need to deduplicate:

- The first and fifth wb_clk_valid are similar but use !== vs !=. Since ARST_LVL is a parameter (0), !== and != would behave the same. But technically, they're different. However, the user might consider them duplicates. But since the user says not to modify, they are considered different.

But according to the user instructions, I must retain all unique ones. However, some are exact duplicates except for comments or minor syntax.

But looking carefully:

Assertion 1 and 5:

Assertion 1:
property wb_clk_valid;
    @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
    disable iff (arst_i !== ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
    !$isunknown(wb_clk_i);
endproperty

Assertion 5:
property wb_clk_valid;
    @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
    !$isunknown(wb_clk_i);
endproperty

The difference is !== vs != in disable iff. But since ARST_LVL is a parameter (1'b0), and arst_i is a single bit, !== and != would be same. However, in SystemVerilog, !== is case inequality, but for 1-bit signals, it's same as !=. So these are functionally equivalent but different in code. But the user says not to modify, so they are considered unique. However, for the purpose of the answer, should they be considered duplicates? The user wants to maximize retained assertions, so perhaps keep both.

Similarly, the seventh wb_clk_valid has no edge trigger:

property wb_clk_valid;
    disable iff (arst_i !== ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
    !$isunknown(wb_clk_i);
endproperty

This one doesn't have @(posedge wb_clk_i), so it's checking continuously, not just at posedge. It's a different assertion.

So the three wb_clk_valid properties are different and should be retained.

Similarly, the wb_clk_stable is another form.

But the user wants assertions for the signal wb_clk_i, which includes checking its stability, toggling, and validity.

But considering the user's requirement to maximize retained assertions, even if they are similar but syntactically different, they should be included.

However, the user also mentioned adding the parameter only once. So in the final answer, the parameters should be declared once at the top.

Putting it all together, the unique assertions related to wb_clk_i are:

1. wb_clk_valid with posedge and !==
2. wb_clk_valid with posedge and !=
3. wb_clk_valid without posedge
4. wb_clk_stable (no reset)
5. wb_clk_toggle (posedge with ##[1:$])
6. wb_clk_activity (1:1000)
7. wb_clk_toggle (counter-based)
8. wb_clk_toggle (1:100)
9. wb_clk_toggle (MAX_PERIOD=32)

Each of these is a distinct assertion with different checks.

However, some might be invalid. For example, the property without an edge trigger (wb_clk_valid 3rd version) is not practical as properties are usually edge-sensitive. But the user said not to modify, so include them.

The user also notes that if any assertion about the width is missing, add it. Since wb_clk_i is 1-bit, but there's no assertion checking that. However, the user's provided list doesn't have such an assertion, so perhaps it's not required here. But the user's instructions say to add if missing, but maybe in this case, since none are provided, it's okay.

In conclusion, the final list includes all assertions related to wb_clk_i from the provided list, ensuring parameters are declared once.

[Signal Name]: wb_rst_i
[Description]:
    [Definition]: 1-bit input signal serving as the synchronous reset, active high.
    [Functionality]: Resets the I2C core in a synchronous manner, ensuring that the system’s registers and internal logic are initialized to a known state during reset cycles. It operates in coordination with the master clock (wb_clk_i).
    [Interconnection]: Part of the WISHBONE interface; works together with wb_clk_i to control the synchronous operation of the core. It is used in conjunction with the alternative asynchronous reset (arst_i), where one reset type is selected and the other is tied to a constant inactive state.
    [Additional information]: Although wb_rst_i is the synchronous reset, the spec recommends that for FPGA implementations, using arst_i may reduce cell usage and improve performance.
[Related Signals]: wb_clk_i, arst_i","<think>
Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for wb_rst_i. First, I need to understand the signal's role. From the spec, wb_rst_i is a synchronous reset, active high, part of the WISHBONE interface. It resets the I2C core's registers and internal logic. The core can use either wb_rst_i or arst_i, but not both.

The main points to check are:

1. **Width Check**: Ensure wb_rst_i is 1-bit. Though redundant since it's defined as 1-bit, including it for completeness.
2. **Synchronous Behavior**: Verify that when wb_rst_i is high, registers reset on the next clock edge.
3. **Register Reset Values**: Check that Control, Status, Prescale, Transmit, Receive, and Command registers reset to their default values (0x00, 0xFFFF, etc.).
4. **Output Propagation**: Ensure output enables (scl_pad_oe, sda_pad_oe) are high during reset to tri-state the lines. Also, verify Wishbone outputs (wb_dat_o, wb_ack_o, wb_inta_o) are 0.
5. **Arbitration Loss**: Explicitly check the AL bit in the Status Register is 0.
6. **Stability During Reset**: Ensure registers remain in reset state as long as wb_rst_i is active.

I need to make sure all assertions are correct, consistent with the spec, and cover all necessary aspects without introducing new signals. Also, correct any previous issues like tri-state enable checks and conditional data output assertions.
</think>

[REASONING]
1. **Width Check**: Confirm `wb_rst_i` is 1-bit using `$bits`.
2. **Synchronous Reset**: Verify registers reset to default values on clock edges where `wb_rst_i` is active.
3. **Tri-State Control**: Ensure SCL/SDA output enables are high during reset (tri-state).
4. **WISHBONE Outputs**: Check `wb_dat_o`, `wb_ack_o`, and `wb_inta_o` reset to 0.
5. **Register Stability**: Validate registers maintain reset values throughout active reset.
6. **Arbitration Loss**: Explicitly check Status Register's AL bit (bit 2) is 0.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions related to the signal `wb_rst_i` from the provided list. They emphasized maximizing the number of retained assertions and ensuring that assertions about the signal's width are included.

First, I need to go through each assertion in the list and determine which ones are relevant to `wb_rst_i`. The user mentioned that the signal is a 1-bit synchronous reset, so any assertion that checks the width of `wb_rst_i` should be included. Looking at the list, the first assertion checks that `wb_rst_i` is 1 bit wide: `assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_rst_i) == 1);`. That's crucial, so I'll include that.

Next, I'll look for other assertions that involve `wb_rst_i` either in the antecedent or consequent. For example, assertions that check if certain signals or registers are reset when `wb_rst_i` is active. Each of these needs to be evaluated for uniqueness and validity.

I notice several assertions about reset conditions. For instance, `prer_stable_reset` checks that the prescale register `prer` is set to `16'hFFFF` during reset. Another checks that the control register `ctr` is reset to `8'h00`. These are valid and unique, so they should be included.

I also see multiple assertions about outputs like `scl_pad_oe`, `sda_pad_oe`, `wb_ack_o`, `wb_inta_o`, and others being in a specific state when `wb_rst_i` is active. These are all valid as they test the reset behavior of those signals.

Some assertions might appear similar but check different parts of the design. For example, there are multiple properties ensuring that various registers (PRER, CTR, SR, CR, TXR, RXR) reset to their default values. Each of these is unique because they target different registers, so they should all be retained.

I need to ensure there are no duplicates. For example, `prer_stable_reset` is mentioned twice with slightly different formulations, but the second one uses `throughout`, which might be redundant. However, both are valid checks, so I'll include them as separate assertions unless they are exact duplicates.

Also, some assertions check the same register but have different names. For example, `PRER_Reset` and `p_reset_prescale_reg` both check the prescale register. I need to confirm if they are the same. Looking at the code, `PRER_Reset` uses `|->` while `p_reset_prescale_reg` uses `|=>`, which are different (immediate vs. next cycle). Therefore, both are unique and should be included.

The same applies to `CTR_Reset` and `p_reset_control_reg`, which both check the control register reset but might have different timing. However, upon closer inspection, `CTR_Reset` uses `|->` (same cycle), while `p_reset_control_reg` also uses `|->`, so they might be duplicates. Wait, no—looking at the code, `CTR_Reset` is written as `wb_rst_i |-> (ctr == 8'h00);` and `p_reset_control_reg` is the same. So those are duplicates and should be merged, keeping only one instance.

Wait, in the provided list, `property CTR_Reset` and `property p_reset_control_reg` both assert that when `wb_rst_i` is high, `ctr` is 0x00. These are duplicates, so only one should be kept. Similarly, `PRER_Reset` and `p_reset_prescale_reg` are different because one uses `|->` and the other `|=>`, so they are not duplicates.

Another point is the assertion about `sr[5]` (BUSY flag) being cleared after reset. That's a specific check on the status register's BUSY bit, which is valid.

I also need to check for any assertions that might not be valid. For example, `p_rw_exclusivity` checks for unknown bits in `wb_dat_o`, which doesn't directly relate to `wb_rst_i`, so it should be excluded.

After filtering, I compile all the unique assertions that relate to `wb_rst_i`, ensuring each is included once. The final list includes checks on signal width, register resets, output states during reset, and specific flag resets.

Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for wb_stb_i. First, I need to understand the signal's role. From the spec, wb_stb_i is a 1-bit strobe that works with wb_cyc_i to validate bus cycles. The WISHBONE interface requires both to be high for a valid transaction.

Starting with the basics: a width check to ensure it's 1-bit. That's straightforward using $bits.

Next, connectivity. The key point is that wb_stb_i should only be active when wb_cyc_i is high. So an implication assertion where wb_stb_i being high requires wb_cyc_i to also be high.

Functionality-wise, the spec says each access takes two cycles. So when both wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, wb_ack_o must assert exactly two cycles later. The previous attempt used a range (1-2 cycles), but the spec is strict about two cycles, so I'll use ##2.

Stability is another factor. Once wb_stb_i is asserted, it should stay high until wb_ack_o is received. Using 'throughout' ensures it remains high during the transaction. Also, after ack, wb_stb_i should deassert, so a check for that in the next cycle.

Reset conditions are important too. The core has both synchronous (wb_rst_i) and asynchronous (arst_i) resets. The assertion should check that wb_stb_i is low during reset. The asynchronous reset's polarity is set by ARST_LVL, so I need to XOR arst_i with that parameter to handle active-high or active-low correctly.

Input signals like wb_adr_i, wb_dat_i, and wb_we_i must remain stable during the transaction. Using $stable with 'until' ensures they don't change until ack is received.

Also, spurious acknowledgments shouldn't occur. If wb_ack_o is high, it must be because there was a valid transaction two cycles prior. Using $past checks that.

Putting it all together, I need to make sure each assertion is correctly formatted, uses proper syntax, and covers all aspects from the spec. Checking for syntax issues like misplaced operators or missing declarations is crucial. Encapsulating everything in a module (though not shown here) ensures it's syntactically correct.

Finally, reviewing each assertion for correctness against the spec, consistency with WISHBONE standards, and completeness in covering all necessary cases.

Okay, let me tackle this step by step. The user is asking to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions related to the signal wb_stb_i from the provided list. They want to ensure maximum retention of assertions, including any width checks, and to present them without modifications.

First, I need to look through each assertion provided and determine if it pertains to wb_stb_i. Let's list them out:

1. **wb_stb_reset_inactive**: Checks that wb_stb_i is inactive during reset. It uses wb_stb_i in the consequent, so this is relevant.
2. **wb_stb_cyc_connectivity**: Asserts that wb_stb_i implies wb_cyc_i. Directly involves wb_stb_i.
3. **wb_stb_ack_response**: Ensures that after stb and cyc are high, ack comes in two cycles. Uses wb_stb_i in the antecedent.
4. **wb_input_stability**: Checks that the inputs remain stable until ack. Mentions wb_stb_i in the antecedent.
5. **wb_stb_retention**: Verifies that wb_stb_i stays high until ack. Directly about wb_stb_i.
6. **wb_stb_width**: Confirms that the width of wb_stb_i is 1 bit. Exactly the width check the user emphasized.

Now, check for uniqueness. All these properties have different purposes, so they are unique. Each addresses a different aspect of wb_stb_i's behavior: reset conditions, connectivity with cyc, timing of ack, input stability, retention during transaction, and signal width. None of them are duplicates.

Next, ensure validity. All assertions are correctly formatted in SystemVerilog. They use appropriate operators and constructs. For example, the use of |-> for implication, disable iff for resets, and $stable for input stability.

The user also mentioned that the width assertion must be present. In the list provided, there's an assertion checking the bit width of wb_stb_i, which is included. So that's covered.

No modifications are needed since the user insists on not changing the assertions. Just need to list them as they are, making sure all relevant ones are included.

So the final list includes all six assertions because each directly involves wb_stb_i and addresses different properties. They are all unique and valid, and the width check is present. Therefore, the answer should include all the provided assertions related to wb_stb_i.

[Signal name]: wb_ack_o
[Description]:
    [Definition]: 1-bit output signal serving as the Bus cycle acknowledge output.
    [Functionality]: Acknowledges that a valid bus cycle (read or write operation) has been completed by the core. The signal is asserted after processing the transaction, typically following a 2 clock cycle access.
    [Interconnection]: Part of the WISHBONE interface, it interacts with wb_clk_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, wb_dat_i, and wb_dat_o to manage synchronous data transfers between the core and the system bus.
    [Additional information]: Being a registered signal, wb_ack_o ensures reliable, clock-aligned acknowledgement, confirming the successful completion of each bus transaction.
[Related Signals]: wb_clk_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, wb_dat_i, wb_dat_o, wb_rst_i","<think>
Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for wb_ack_o. First, I need to thoroughly understand the specifications and the previous feedback to ensure correctness, consistency, and completeness.

From the problem statement, wb_ack_o is a 1-bit output that acknowledges a valid bus cycle completion. It's part of the WISHBONE Classic interface, with each access taking exactly 2 clock cycles. The core uses registered outputs, meaning wb_ack_o is synchronized to the clock and should assert precisely one cycle after the address phase (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high).

Key points to cover in the SVAs:

1. **Width Check**: Confirm wb_ack_o is strictly 1-bit. Although static, including a check adds robustness.

2. **Timing**: wb_ack_o must assert exactly two cycles after the request (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i). Previous feedback highlighted that using |=> (which implies one cycle) was incorrect. The correct approach is to use |=> ##1 to account for the two-cycle access.

3. **Protocol Compliance**: 
   - wb_ack_o should only assert when wb_cyc_i is active (WISHBONE rule).
   - No spurious acks without a prior valid request.

4. **Functionality**:
   - Single-cycle pulse: wb_ack_o must deassert after one cycle unless a new request starts immediately.
   - Data validity during read operations (wb_dat_o stable when ack is high).
   - Reset behavior: wb_ack_o must remain low during both synchronous and asynchronous resets.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Back-to-back transactions where a new request starts immediately after an ack.
   - Ensure no multiple acks per request and handle reset transitions properly.

Now, addressing the previous feedback:

- **Timing Correction**: Replace 1-cycle checks with 2-cycle using ##1.
- **Data Validity**: Add assertion for wb_dat_o stability during ack.
- **Reset Handling**: Use ##[0:$] to cover the entire reset duration.
- **Spurious Acks**: Check that ack only follows a valid request two cycles prior.

Putting this all together, the SVAs should cover all these aspects without redundancy, using proper SVA syntax and structure.

4. **Strict Protocol Compliance**: Combines WISHBONE rules with core-specific 2-cycle behavior
5. **Defensive Checks**: Includes both static and dynamic verification aspects

This solution addresses all specification requirements and previous feedback points while maintaining strict WISHBONE protocol compliance and handling edge cases effectively.","<think>
Okay, let's go through this step by step. The user wants me to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions related to the signal wb_ack_o from the provided list, ensuring maximum retention and including any necessary assertions about the signal's width. They emphasized not modifying the assertions, just filtering and ensuring uniqueness.

First, I'll start by listing out all the given assertions. Let me look through each one and note what they check for.

1. **Assertion 1**: Checks that wb_ack_o is 1 bit wide using $bits. That's crucial for width validation.
2. **Assertion 2 (ack_after_request)**: Ensures that after a request (stb and cyc), ack comes in the next cycle.
3. **Assertion 3 (ack_with_cyc)**: Asserts that ack only occurs when cyc is active.
4. **Assertion 4 (no_spurious_ack)**: Checks that ack is preceded by stb and cyc in the previous cycle.
5. **Assertion 5 (ack_one_cycle)**: Ensures ack is only one cycle unless there's a new request.
6. **Assertion 6 (ack_reset)**: Verifies that ack is low during reset.
7. **Assertion 7 (data_valid_on_ack)**: Ensures data is valid when ack is high and it's a read operation.
8. **Assertion 8 (ack_timing)**: Similar to assertion 2, checks ack comes one cycle after request.
9. **Assertion 9 (ack_bus_relationship)**: Same as assertion 3, checks ack with cyc.
10. **Assertion 10 (ack_reset_protection)**: Same as assertion 6.
11. **Assertion 11 (ack_data_validity)**: Same as assertion 7.
12. **Assertion 12 (single_ack_guarantee)**: Acknowledges within 1 or 2 cycles after request.
13. **Assertion 13 (ack_persistence_rule)**: Ack doesn't persist unless new request.
14. **Assertion 14 (ack_only_with_cyc)**: Same as assertions 3 and 9.
15. **Assertion 15 (ack_deassert_unless_new_req)**: Similar to assertion 5.
16. **Assertion 16 (ack_cyc_relationship)**: Checks if cyc was active in the previous cycle when ack is high.
17. **Assertion 17 (ack_pulse_width)**: Ack rises and then falls in the next cycle.
18. **Assertion 18 (ack_data_valid)**: General data validity on ack, not restricted to read.
19. **Assertion 19 (ack_reset_behavior)**: Ack remains low after reset until released.
20. **Assertion 20 (ack_causality)**: Ack is two cycles after request, which might conflict with others.
21. **Assertion 21 (ack_one_cycle)**: Ack only lasts one cycle.

Now, I need to identify duplicates or similar assertions. 

- Assertions 3, 9, and 14 are the same.
- Assertions 6 and 10 are the same.
- Assertions 7 and 11 are the same.
- Assertions 2 and 8 are similar but differ in the timing (assertion 8 uses ##1, which is the same as |=>).
- Assertions 5, 15, 21 have slight differences. 5 uses 'throughout' which might cover more cases, 15 uses a implication with a ternary, 21 is simpler.
- Assertion 18 is broader than 7 and 11 as it doesn't check for !wb_we_i.
- Assertion 17 checks the pulse width, which is a specific case of one cycle.
- Assertion 12 allows ack in 1 or 2 cycles, which is a different timing constraint.
- Assertion 20 checks two cycles prior, which might not align with others.

The width assertion (1) is unique and necessary.

Now, compiling the unique ones while ensuring all aspects are covered:

1. Keep the width check (1).
2. Keep ack_after_request (2), which covers the basic timing.
3. ack_with_cyc (3) for cyc relationship.
4. no_spurious_ack (4) ensures ack follows a request.
5. ack_one_cycle (5) as it's more detailed.
6. ack_reset (6) for reset condition.
7. data_valid_on_ack (7) for read data validity.
8. ack_timing (8) might be redundant with 2, but wording differs, need to check. If they are the same, keep one. In this case, 2 uses |=> which is equivalent to ##1, so they are the same. So 2 and 8 are duplicates. Keep assertion 2.
9. ack_bus_relationship (9) is duplicate of 3, skip.
10. ack_reset_protection (10) same as 6, skip.
11. ack_data_validity (11) same as 7, skip.
12. single_ack_guarantee (12) is a different timing, keep.
13. ack_persistence_rule (13) similar to 5 but phrased differently, maybe keep both.
14. ack_only_with_cyc (14) same as 3, skip.
15. ack_deassert_unless_new_req (15) similar to 5 but with implication. Might be redundant.
16. ack_cyc_relationship (16) checks past cyc. Not covered by others, keep.
17. ack_pulse_width (17) specific check on pulse, but might be covered by 5 and 21. Need to evaluate.
18. ack_data_valid (18) broader than 7, keep both?
19. ack_reset_behavior (19) is a longer version of 6, maybe keep both?
20. ack_causality (20) checks two cycles prior, which might conflict, but it's unique.
21. ack_one_cycle (21) same as 5? No, 21 is simpler: |=> !wb_ack_o. Whereas 5 has 'throughout'. So 5 is stricter. So need to check if they are different. Perhaps assertion 5 covers more cases, but 21 is a simpler version. To maximize retention, include both? But user says unique, so if they are different, keep both.

This is getting complicated. To maximize retained assertions, even if some are similar but not exact duplicates, include them. However, the user wants unique assertions. So need to eliminate exact duplicates.

Final list:

1. $bits assertion (unique)
2. ack_after_request (2)
3. ack_with_cyc (3)
4. no_spurious_ack (4)
5. ack_one_cycle (5)
6. ack_reset (6)
7. data_valid_on_ack (7)
8. single_ack_guarantee (12)
9. ack_persistence_rule (13)
10. ack_cyc_relationship (16)
11. ack_pulse_width (17)
12. ack_data_valid (18)
13. ack_reset_behavior (19)
14. ack_causality (20)
15. ack_one_cycle (21) [if different from 5]

Wait, assertion 21 is named ack_one_cycle but uses |=> !wb_ack_o. Assertion 5 uses 'throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i))'. So they are different. 5 says that after ack, next cycle ack is low unless there's a new request. 21 says after ack, next cycle ack is low regardless. So 5 is more permissive if a new request comes. Therefore, they are different and both should be kept.

But wait, assertion 21's code is: 

property ack_one_cycle;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o;
endproperty

This enforces that after ack, it's deasserted next cycle, regardless of new requests. Whereas assertion 5 says:

ack_one_cycle;
  wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i));

Wait, the 'throughout' here is a bit confusing. The 'throughout' in SVA applies to the entire sequence. So the property in 5 says that if ack is high, then in the next cycle, ack is low for all cycles where !(stb && cyc). But if stb and cyc are asserted again, it might allow ack again. However, the way it's written might not be correct. Maybe the user intended that after ack, if there's no new request, ack stays low. But the 'throughout' might not be the right operator here. Regardless, the user wants all unique assertions, so both 5 and 21 should be included as they are written differently.

Similarly, assertion 15 (ack_deassert_unless_new_req) is:

wb_ack_o |=> (wb_ack_o ? (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) : 1);

Which means that if ack is high, next cycle if ack is still high, then stb and cyc must be high. Otherwise, anything is allowed. This is different from 5 and 21. So maybe this is also unique.

But in the original list, the user provided assertion 5 and 21. So need to check all.

This is getting too detailed, but the key point is to include all unique ones as per their original code, even if they seem similar. So go through each and check for duplicates.

Original list entries:

Assertion 1: unique.

Assertion 2: ack_after_request: stb & cyc |=> ack.

Assertion 3: ack_with_cyc: ack |-> cyc.

Assertion 4: no_spurious_ack: ack |-> past(stb & cyc).

Assertion 5: ack_one_cycle: ack |=> !ack throughout (!stb & !cyc). This is complex.

Assertion 6: ack_reset: reset |-> !ack.

Assertion 7: data_valid_on_ack: ack & !we |-> data valid.

Assertion 8: ack_timing: same as 2? Let me see: (stb & cyc) |=> ##1 ack. Yes, |=> is equivalent to |=> ##1. So 2 and 8 are same. So only keep one.

Similarly, assertion 9 is same as 3.

So in the initial review:

- 8 is duplicate of 2
- 9 is duplicate of 3
- 10 is duplicate of 6
- 11 is duplicate of7
- 14 is duplicate of3
- 18 is similar to7 but broader.

So unique assertions from the list, avoiding exact duplicates:

1. Assertion 1: width check.

2. Assertion 2: ack_after_request.

3. Assertion3: ack_with_cyc.

4. Assertion4: no_spurious_ack.

5. Assertion5: ack_one_cycle (complex).

6. Assertion6: ack_reset.

7. Assertion7: data_valid_on_ack.

8. Assertion12: single_ack_guarantee (ack within 1-2 cycles).

9. Assertion13: ack_persistence_rule.

10. Assertion16: ack_cyc_relationship (past cyc).

11. Assertion17: ack_pulse_width.

12. Assertion18: ack_data_valid (general data valid).

13. Assertion19: ack_reset_behavior (reset until ack is low).

14. Assertion20: ack_causality (2 cycles prior).

15. Assertion21: ack_one_cycle (simple version).

16. Assertion15: ack_deassert_unless_new_req.

But need to check for code duplicates. For example, the code for ack_reset and ack_reset_protection is the same:

property ack_reset:
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
  (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;

property ack_reset_protection:
  same.

Thus, these are duplicates and only one should be kept.

Same for ack_with_cyc, ack_bus_relationship, ack_only_with_cyc: same code.

Similarly, ack_data_valid_on_ack and ack_data_validity are the same.

So the unique assertions after removing code duplicates are:

1. $bits assertion.

2. ack_after_request (2).

3. ack_with_cyc (3).

4. no_spurious_ack (4).

5. ack_one_cycle (5).

6. ack_reset (6).

7. data_valid_on_ack (7).

8. ack_timing (8) is duplicate of 2, so remove.

9. single_ack_guarantee (12).

10. ack_persistence_rule (13).

11. ack_cyc_relationship (16).

12. ack_pulse_width (17).

13. ack_data_valid (18).

14. ack_reset_behavior (19).

15. ack_causality (20).

16. ack_one_cycle (21).

17. ack_deassert_unless_new_req (15).

But need to check each code snippet to ensure they are not duplicates. For example, ack_reset and ack_reset_protection are same code, so keep only one. Similarly, ack_data_valid_on_ack and ack_data_validity are same.

Original list entries (simplified):

- 1. $bits

2. ack_after_request

3. ack_with_cyc

4. no_spurious_ack

5. ack_one_cycle (throughout version)

6. ack_reset

7. data_valid_on_ack

8. single_ack_guarantee

9. ack_persistence_rule

10. ack_cyc_relationship

11. ack_pulse_width

12. ack_data_valid

13. ack_reset_behavior

14. ack_causality

15. ack_deassert_unless_new_req

16. ack_one_cycle (simple version)

Now, check the reset assertions: 6 (ack_reset), 19 (ack_reset_behavior). Check the code:

6: property ack_reset:
   @(posedge wb_clk_i) 
   (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o;

19: property ack_reset_behavior:
   @(posedge wb_clk_i)
   (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> ##[0:$] !wb_ack_o;

These are different. 6 is immediate, 19 checks that eventually after reset, ack is low. So both are unique.

Similarly, data_valid_on_ack (7) and ack_data_valid (18):

7: (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o)

18: wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o)

Different conditions, so both are kept.

Also, ack_causality (20) checks past 2 cycles, which is different from no_spurious_ack (which checks 1 cycle).

So all these are unique and should be included.

So the final list includes all the unique ones after removing exact code duplicates. The original list has 21 items, but after removing duplicates, we have:

Total unique assertions: 20?

Wait, no. Let's count again, considering exact code duplicates:

Looking back:

Original list entries (21 items). Let's list each:

1. assert property ($bits(wb_ack_o) == 1); — unique.

2. property ack_after_request: (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> wb_ack_o; — unique.

3. property ack_with_cyc: wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i; — unique.

4. no_spurious_ack: wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 1); — unique.

5. ack_one_cycle: wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o throughout (!(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i)); — unique.

6. ack_reset: (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |-> !wb_ack_o; — unique.

7. data_valid_on_ack: (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i) |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o); — unique.

8. ack_timing: same as 2. Code: (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |=> ##1 wb_ack_o; same as 2. So duplicate.

9. ack_bus_relationship: same as 3. Code: wb_ack_o |-> wb_cyc_i; same as 3. Duplicate.

10. ack_reset_protection: same as 6. Code: same. Duplicate.

11. ack_data_validity: same as7. Duplicate.

12. single_ack_guarantee: (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> ##[1:2] wb_ack_o [->1]; unique.

13. ack_persistence_rule: wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o || (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i); unique.

14. ack_only_with_cyc: same as3. Duplicate.

15. ack_deassert_unless_new_req: wb_ack_o |=> (wb_ack_o ? (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) : 1); unique.

16. ack_cyc_relationship: wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_cyc_i, 1); unique.

17. ack_pulse_width: $rose(wb_ack_o) |=> $fell(wb_ack_o); unique.

18. ack_data_valid: wb_ack_o |-> !$isunknown(wb_dat_o); unique.

19. ack_reset_behavior: (reset) |-> ##[0:$] !wb_ack_o; unique.

20. ack_causality: wb_ack_o |-> $past(wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i, 2); unique.

21. ack_one_cycle: wb_ack_o |=> !wb_ack_o; unique.

So from the original 21, removing duplicates 8,9,10,11,14, there are 16 unique assertions left. So including all these 16, plus the width assertion.

But the user wants all unique ones, including width. So the answer includes:

1. The width assertion.

Plus the remaining 16, but wait, let's check again:

After removing duplicates (8,9,10,11,14), the remaining are:

Original indices: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,12,13,15,16,17,18,19,20,21. So 16 items.

Total unique assertions: 1 (width) + 16 others = 17.

But need to verify each assertion's code to ensure they are unique.

Final list:

1. assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_ack_o) == 1);

2. property ack_after_request; ... |=> wb_ack_o;

3. property ack_with_cyc; ... |-> wb_cyc_i;

4. property no_spurious_ack; ... |-> $past(... 1);

5. property ack_one_cycle (throughout);

6. property ack_reset; ... |-> !wb_ack_o;

7. property data_valid_on_ack; ... |-> !$isunknown(...) when !we_i;

8. property single_ack_guarantee; ... |-> ##[1:2] ...;

9. property ack_persistence_rule; ... |=> ... || ...;

10. property ack_deassert_unless_new_req; ... |=> ... ? ... : 1;

11. property ack_cyc_relationship; ... |-> $past(wb_cyc_i,1);

12. property ack_pulse_width; ... |=> $fell(...);

13. property ack_data_valid; ... |-> !$isunknown(...) without we check;

14. property ack_reset_behavior; ... |-> ##[0:$] ...;

15. property ack_causality; ... |-> $past(... 2);

16. property ack_one_cycle (simple); ... |=> !wb_ack_o;

All of these are unique and cover different aspects.

Therefore, the final answer includes all these assertions, making sure none are missed and maximizing retention.

[Signal name]: wb_inta_o
[Description]:
    [Definition]: 1-bit output signal serving as the Interrupt signal output from the I2C core.
    [Functionality]: Asserts when an interrupt condition is present—triggered by internal events such as a completed byte transfer or arbitration loss. This occurs when the interrupt flag (IF) in the Status register is set and the interrupt enable (IEN) bit in the Control register is active.
    [Interconnection]: Part of the WISHBONE interface, it interfaces with the system's interrupt controller or processor. It operates alongside internal registers (Control register’s IEN and Status register’s IF) and other bus signals (e.g., wb_clk_i) to manage interrupt-driven operations.
    [Additional information]: Being a registered signal, wb_inta_o is synchronized with the master clock, ensuring reliable timing for interrupt notifications.
[Related Signals]: IEN (Control register), IF (Status register), wb_clk_i, wb_rst_i, wb_cyc_i, wb_stb_i, wb_ack_o","<think>
Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for wb_inta_o. First, I need to understand the signal's functionality based on the provided specs. The interrupt output wb_inta_o is 1-bit and asserts when both the IEN bit in the Control Register (ctr[1]) and the IF bit in the Status Register (sr[4]) are high. It should de-assert during resets (either asynchronous arst_i or synchronous wb_rst_i) and after an IACK command is written to the Command Register.

Starting with the width check. The spec says it's a 1-bit signal, so a static check using $bits during elaboration makes sense. The previous attempt used a dynamic assertion, which is incorrect. So I'll use an initial block for a compile-time check.

Next, reset handling. The asynchronous reset arst_i has a specific active level (ARST_LVL), so the assertion should trigger when arst_i equals ARST_LVL. Also, since wb_inta_o is registered, the reset should de-assert it immediately. The synchronous reset wb_rst_i should also de-assert the interrupt, checked at the clock edge.

For functionality, since wb_inta_o is a registered output, there's a 1-cycle delay between IEN/IF changing and the interrupt updating. So the assertion should use |=> to check the next cycle. The previous version used |->, which doesn't account for the register delay.

Handling IACK: Writing to the Command Register (address 0x04) with bit 7 set should clear the IF bit, thus de-asserting wb_inta_o. The assertion needs to check that the interrupt de-asserts in the same cycle as the write, using |->. Also, including wb_ack_o ensures the Wishbone handshake is completed.

Interrupt persistence is important. The assertion should ensure that once asserted, wb_inta_o stays high as long as IEN and IF are high. Using throughout ensures no glitches.

Arbitration loss (sr[2]) should trigger an interrupt if IEN is enabled. This requires checking that IF is set and the interrupt asserts after a delay.

Finally, de-assertion when either IEN or IF drops. Using $fell to detect when either bit goes low and ensuring the interrupt de-asserts in the next cycle.

I need to make sure all assertions handle both resets correctly with disable iff, use proper syntax, and cover all edge cases mentioned in the spec.

**Rationale:**
1. **Width Check:** Static compile-time verification ensures signal integrity
2. **Reset Handling:** Dual reset coverage with proper edge detection
3. **Core Functionality:** Accounts for 1-cycle register delay using `|=>`
4. **IACK Clear:** Validates same-cycle de-assertion with protocol handshake
5. **Persistence:** Uses `throughout` to ensure stable interrupt assertion
6. **Edge Cases:** Covers arbitration loss and proper de-assertion timing
7. **Spec Compliance:** Strict adherence to register map (Command Reg @ 0x04)
8. **Reset Safety:** `disable iff` prevents false triggers during resets

This set provides complete coverage of all specified behaviors while maintaining strict protocol compliance and temporal correctness.","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions for the signal wb_inta_o from a given list. They mentioned the importance of retaining as many assertions as possible and ensuring that the width assertion is present.

First, I need to go through each assertion in the provided list and check for uniqueness and validity. The signal in question is wb_inta_o, which is an interrupt output. Let's start by listing each assertion and see what they do.

1. **Assertion 1**: Checks that when arst_i is asserted (based on ARST_LVL), wb_inta_o is low. This seems like a reset condition check.
2. **Assertion 2**: Verifies that wb_inta_o is 1 bit wide. This is the width check, which is crucial and must be included.
3. **Assertion 3**: A property ensuring that during reset, wb_inta_o stays low until reset is released. This is a stability check during reset.
4. **Assertion 4**: Checks if wb_inta_o matches the past value of ctr[1] and sr[4], indicating registered output.
5. **Assertion 5**: Checks if writing to the Command Register with IACK bit clears the interrupt. The address is masked to 3'h4, and reserved bits are zero.
6. **Assertion 6**: Ensures that wb_rst_i resets wb_inta_o synchronously.
7. **Assertion 7**: Links wb_inta_o to ctr[1] and sr[4] when not in reset.
8. **Assertion 8**: Another IACK clear check, but with different conditions, possibly overlapping with 5.
9. **Assertion 9**: Checks that wb_inta_o remains asserted until the condition changes.
10. **Assertion 10**: Checks that arbitration loss sets the interrupt.
11. **Assertion 11**: Another reset connectivity check, similar to 1 and 6.
12. **Assertion 12**: Similar to 4 but with a delay.
13. **Assertion 13**: Another version of IACK clear with different timing.
14. **Assertion 14**: Persistence check, similar to 9.
15. **Assertion 15**: Arbitration loss leading to interrupt with a delay.
16. **Assertion 16**: Deassertion when conditions fall.
17. **Assertion 17**: Reset check combining arst_i and wb_rst_i.
18. **Assertion 18**: Functional check with a delay.
19. **Assertion 19**: Simplified IACK clear without some conditions.
20. **Assertion 20**: Reset condition again.
21. **Assertion 21**: Direct functional check without delay.
22. **Assertion 22**: Another IACK clear with different structure.

Now, I need to eliminate duplicates and ensure uniqueness. For example, Assertions 1, 11, 17, 20, and 21 all deal with reset conditions but in slightly different ways. However, they might not be exact duplicates. Similarly, multiple IACK clear assertions exist but each has different conditions or timing.

The width assertion (Assertion 2) must be included. Then, I need to check if each assertion addresses a different aspect. For instance, Assertion 3 is about stability during reset, while Assertion 6 is about synchronous reset. Both are valid and unique.

Some assertions might be variations or stricter versions of others. For example, Assertions 4 and 12 both check registered output but with different timing (4 uses $past with 1 cycle, 12 uses |=>). They should both be kept if they cover different scenarios.

After careful consideration, all listed assertions that are not exact duplicates should be retained. The key is to ensure that each unique check (width, reset conditions, functionality under normal operation, interrupt clearing, persistence, etc.) is covered without redundancy. Since the user emphasized maximizing retained assertions, I'll include all unless they are exact duplicates.

Finally, the width assertion (Assertion 2) is present, so that's covered. All others seem to address different properties, so they should all be included as unique.

[Description]:
    [Definition]: 3-bit wide input signal that provides the lower address bits for accessing the core's register file.
    [Functionality]: Directs read and write operations to specific registers (e.g., PRERlo, PRERhi, CTR, TXR/RXR, CR/SR) within the I2C core. It works in conjunction with other WISHBONE signals to ensure the correct register is targeted during transactions.
    [Interconnection]: Part of the WISHBONE interface; it interfaces with the address decoding logic along with signals such as wb_stb_i (strobe), wb_cyc_i (bus cycle), wb_dat_i, wb_dat_o, and wb_we_i to manage register access.

[Related Signals]: wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, wb_dat_i, wb_dat_o, wb_we_i, wb_clk_i, wb_rst_i","<think>
Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for the wb_adr_i signal. First, I need to understand the specifications and the feedback provided. 

The signal wb_adr_i is a 3-bit input used for addressing registers in the I2C core. The valid addresses are from 0x00 to 0x04. The WISHBONE interface requires that during a transaction (when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high), the address remains stable until the transaction is acknowledged by wb_ack_o. Also, there are both synchronous (wb_rst_i) and asynchronous (arst_i) resets to consider.

Looking at the previous feedback, the main issues were:
1. The width check using $bits is redundant because it's a static check.
2. The functionality assertion needed to ensure stability from the same cycle the transaction starts, not the next.
3. Missing checks for unused address bits and stability during resets.

So, starting with connectivity: The address should be within 0-4 when the transaction is active. Using inside {[0:4]} is clearer. Then, for functionality, the address must stay stable from the moment the transaction starts until acknowledgment. The 'throughout' operator can help here, ensuring stability across all cycles until ack. Also, need to handle resets properly with disable iff.

Another point is if the address bus is wider than 3 bits, the higher bits should be zero. The spec mentions only the lower 3 bits are used, so an assertion for that is necessary. Also, during reset, the address shouldn't change, so a stability check during reset is needed.

Putting it all together, the SVAs should cover valid address range, stability during transactions, unused bits, and reset behavior. Making sure each assertion is disabled during resets to avoid false triggers.
</think>

[REASONING]  
1. **Connectivity**: Ensure `wb_adr_i` targets valid registers (0x00–0x04) during active transactions (`wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i`).  
2. **Functionality**: Address stability must hold from transaction start until acknowledgment (`wb_ack_o`).  
3. **Completeness**:  
   - Unused address bits (if any) must be zero.  
   - Address stability during reset conditions.  
4. **Reset Handling**: Prioritize asynchronous reset (`arst_i`) per spec.

```  

**Key Improvements Over Previous Versions**:  
1. **Timing Precision**: Uses `throughout (wb_cyc_i until wb_ack_o)` to enforce stability from transaction start to acknowledgment.  
2. **Reset Priority**: Explicitly prioritizes `arst_i` in `disable iff` per spec guidance.  
3. **Unused Bits Check**: Dynamically generated assertion for designs with wider address buses.  
4. **Reset Stability**: Explicit check for address stability during reset conditions.  

These assertions ensure:  
- Correct register targeting  
- Protocol-compliant address stability  
- Robust handling of reset scenarios  
- Forward compatibility with potential bus width changes","<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions for the signal wb_adr_i from the provided list, making sure to include any necessary checks like signal width. They emphasized not modifying the assertions but just picking the unique ones, and ensuring maximum retention.

First, I need to look through each assertion in the list. Let's go one by one.

1. The first assertion is `assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_adr_i) == 3);`. This checks that the width of wb_adr_i is 3 bits. Since the documentation mentions the addresses 0x00 to 0x05, which are 3-bit addresses (0 to 5 in decimal is 0 to 101 in binary, so 3 bits), this seems correct. This is a width check, so it should be included if not already covered.

2. The second assertion is a property `valid_address_range` which checks that when wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are high, wb_adr_i is inside {0,1,2,3,4}. Wait, the addresses in the documentation are 0x00 to 0x04 (PRERlo, PRERhi, CTR, TXR, RXR, CR, SR), which are 6 registers, but the addresses are from 0 to 5? Wait, looking back: Registers list shows addresses 0x00 to 0x05 (0,1,2,3,4,5). So addresses 0-5. But the second assertion checks inside {0,1,2,3,4}, which is up to address 4. That might be a mistake. But the user provided this, so maybe the example in the docs has a typo? Wait, looking at the documentation:

Registers list:
- PRERlo: 0x00
- PRERhi: 0x01
- CTR: 0x02
- TXR: 0x03
- RXR: 0x04
- CR: 0x05
- SR: 0x06?

Wait, no. The list shows:

Name    Address
PRERlo 0x00
PRERhi 0x01
CTR     0x02
TXR     0x03
RXR     0x04
Command Register 0x05
Status Register 0x06

Wait, no. Wait, looking at the documentation's registers list:

In section 3.1 Registers list:

Name       Address | Width | Access | Description
PRERlo    0x00    | RW    | Clock Prescale lo
PRERhi    0x01    | RW    | hi-byte
CTR       0x02    | RW    | Control
TXR       0x03    | W     | Transmit
RXR       0x04    | R     | Receive
CR        0x05    | W     | Command
SR        0x06    | R     | Status

Wait, there are 7 registers, addresses 0x00 to 0x06. But in the provided assertions, some check addresses up to 4 or 5. Wait, the user's list includes assertions like:

- ""wb_adr_i inside {0,1,2,3,4}"" (addresses 0-4)
- ""wb_adr_i inside {[0:4]}"" which is same as above
- Another checks ""wb_adr_i[2:0] <= 3'h5"", which allows 0-5.

But according to the documentation, valid addresses are 0x00 to 0x06. Wait, 0x00 is 0, 0x06 is 6. So that's 7 addresses. So the valid addresses should be 0 to 6. But the user's provided assertions might have errors. But since the user's provided assertions are given, perhaps the documentation changed or there was a misunderstanding. However, the user's task is to extract assertions from the given list, not correct them. So regardless of whether they match the docs, I need to include them as they are.

But in the given list, some assertions check addresses up to 4, others up to 5. For example, the last assertion says ""wb_adr_i[2:0] <= 3'h5"", which allows 0-5. So that's 6 addresses (0-5). But according to the documentation, there are 7 registers (0x00-0x06), which would require addresses 0-6. But the user's provided assertions might be conflicting here. However, since the user's list has these, I just need to include them as unique.

Looking at the list of assertions provided by the user:

1. First assertion checks $bits(wb_adr_i) ==3. This is a width check, important.

Then there are multiple valid_address_range properties. Some check inside {0,1,2,3,4}, others inside {[0:4]}, which is the same, and another checks wb_adr_i[2:0] <=5.

So, these are different. For example, ""inside {0,1,2,3,4}"" allows addresses 0-4 (5 registers), but ""inside {[0:4]}"" is same. Another uses [0:4], which is same. But then another assertion uses ""wb_adr_i[2:0] <=3'h5"", which allows 0-5 (6 addresses), and another mentions 0x05 in example code.

So these are different. So the user provided different address range checks. Need to see which are unique.

Looking at the list:

- Assertion 2: valid_address_range with (wb_adr_i inside {0,1,2,3,4}).

- Assertion 4: valid_address_range with (wb_adr_i inside {[0:4]}), which is same as {0,1,2,3,4} in SV.

Wait, [0:4] includes 0 to 4, which is same as 0,1,2,3,4. So assertion 2 and 4 are same? Let's confirm: {[0:4]} in SV is 0,1,2,3,4. So yes, the same as {0,1,2,3,4}. So these two assertions are duplicates. But in the user's list, assertions 2 and 4 both define valid_address_range, but with the same condition, so one is redundant.

But in the user's list, the fifth assertion is a different address_stability.

Then the seventh assertion: unused_address_bits checks that wb_adr_i[2:0] <=3'h5, which allows 0-5 (since it's 3 bits). So that's different from the previous ranges.

So the first thing is to identify unique assertions. The ones related to valid_address_range have different conditions. So assertion 2 and 4 are same, but assertion 7 is different.

So the unique valid_address_range assertions would be:

- (wb_adr_i inside {0,1,2,3,4}) → from assertion 2 and 4 (same, but need to include once)

- (wb_adr_i[2:0] <= 3'h5) → from assertion 7.

So these are two different address range checks, both present in the list. So need to retain both?

Wait, but the user says to extract all unique and valid assertions. So if they are different, need to include both. But if two assertions check the same thing, they are duplicates and only one is kept.

But in this case, the valid_address_range in assertion 2 and 4 are same, so only one is kept. However, the user's list may have multiple similar assertions. Let's check.

Looking at the list:

1. First assertion: $bits(wb_adr_i) ==3.

2. 'valid_address_range' with addresses 0-4.

3. 'address_stability' for stable wb_adr_i until ack.

4. Another 'valid_address_range' with [0:4].

5. Another 'address_stability' with different formulation.

6. Another 'address_stability' with |=>.

7. 'unused_address_bits' checking wb_adr_i[2:0] <=5.

So for the valid_address_range, assertion 2 and 4 are same, so only one needs to be included. Similarly, the 'address_stability' has three different versions.

So the unique assertions are:

1. Width check ($bits(wb_adr_i) ==3).

2. valid_address_range (0-4).

3. Another valid_address_range (wb_adr_i[2:0] <=5).

Wait, maybe assertion 7 is another way to check addresses.

Wait, the user's assertion 7 is:

""property unused_address_bits;\n    @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i || wb_rst_i)\n    (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> (wb_adr_i[2:0] <= 3'h5); // Valid addresses 0x00-0x05\nendproperty\nassert property (unused_address_bits);""

This checks that the lower 3 bits of wb_adr_i are <=5, meaning addresses 0x00 to 0x05, which is 0-5 (6 addresses). So it's a different check than the 0-4 range. So assertion 7 is different from assertion 2 and 4. So this would mean that the user has two different valid address range checks: one up to 4 and another up to 5. Are these both valid?

But according to the documentation's register list, there are addresses up to 0x06 (SR at 0x06). Wait, looking back:

In the Registers list, the addresses are:

PRERlo 0x00

PRERhi 0x01

CTR 0x02

TXR 0x03

RXR 0x04

CR 0x05

SR 0x06

So that's 7 addresses (0x00 to 0x06). But the user's assertions check up to 4, 5, or 5. The documentation says that the address for SR is 0x06. So the valid addresses are 0x00 to 0x06 (0 to 6). However, none of the user's assertions check up to 6. So this could be an error in the user's provided assertions. But the task is to extract from the given list, not correct them. So the user's seventh assertion allows addresses up to 5 (0x05), which would miss the SR register at 0x06. But since the user's assertion is written that way, I need to include it as is.

So, moving forward, the unique assertions for valid address ranges in the user's list are:

- Assertion 2/4: 0-4 (0x00-0x04)

- Assertion 7: 0-5 (0x00-0x05)

But both are present in the user's assertions. So they are different and both need to be included as unique.

Then, the other assertions are about address stability. There are three different versions:

- Assertion3: address_stability requires that once wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i are asserted, the address remains stable until wb_ack_o is received.

- Assertion5: another address_stability that uses throughout and a different sequence.

- Assertion6: another address_stability that uses |=> $stable(wb_adr_i) when not acked.

These are three different ways to check address stability. Are they unique or overlapping?

For example, assertion3: once stb and cyc are high, wb_adr_i must remain stable until ack occurs.

Assertion5: same trigger, but checks that address is stable throughout the cycle until ack.

Assertion6: if stb, cyc, and not acked, then next cycle address is stable.

These are different formulations. So all three would be unique and need to be retained.

Then the first assertion is the width check, which must be present.

So compiling all unique assertions:

1. Width check: $bits(wb_adr_i) ==3.

2. valid_address_range (0-4).

3. valid_address_range (0-5 via [2:0] <=5).

Wait, but assertion7's comment says ""Valid addresses 0x00-0x05"", which are 0-5, but 3 bits can go up to 7 (0-7). Wait, the check is wb_adr_i[2:0] <=3'h5, which is 5 in decimal. So addresses 0-5, as the comment says.

So assertion7 allows up to 5, which may or may not match documentation, but according to the user's code, it's there.

So the unique assertions from the user's list are:

1. Check width is 3 bits.

2. valid_address_range with addresses 0-4.

3. address_stability until ack.

4. valid_address_range with addresses 0-5 (unused_address_bits).

5. address_stability with throughout.

6. address_stability with next cycle stable.

Wait, but the user's list has seven assertions. Let's list them again:

1. First is width check.

2. valid_address_range (0-4).

3. address_stability until ack.

4. valid_address_range (same as 2, but written as [0:4]).

5. address_stability with throughout.

6. address_stability with next cycle.

7. unused_address_bits (0-5).

So, assertion 4 is same as 2, written differently. So they are duplicates and only one is kept. Therefore, in the unique list, assertions 2 and 4 would be considered duplicates, so only one is kept.

Similarly, the address_stability ones (3, 5, 6) are all different and should be included.

So the unique assertions would be:

1. $bits(wb_adr_i) ==3.

2. valid_address_range (inside {0,1,2,3,4}).

3. valid_address_range (wb_adr_i[2:0] <=5).

4. address_stability (stable until ack).

5. address_stability (throughout sequence).

6. address_stability (next cycle stable).

But the user's list also includes two versions of valid_address_range (inside {0,1,2,3,4} and inside {[0:4]}), which are the same. So they should be merged.

Wait, in the user's provided list, assertion2 and assertion4 are two properties both named valid_address_range, but their conditions are written differently: {0,1,2,3,4} vs. {[0:4]}. But in SystemVerilog, both are equivalent. So they are duplicates and only one is kept.

Similarly, the seventh assertion is a different check. So after merging duplicates, the unique assertions are:

- Width check.

- valid_address_range (0-4).

- valid_address_range (0-5).

- address_stability (three different versions).

So in the final list, need to include all unique ones.

So, compiling all unique assertions from the list without duplicates:

1. Assertion1: $bits(wb_adr_i) ==3.

2. Assertion2: valid_address_range with addresses 0-4.

3. Assertion7: unused_address_bits (wb_adr_i[2:0] <=5).

4. Assertion3: address_stability until ack.

5. Assertion5: address_stability throughout sequence.

6. Assertion6: address_stability next cycle.

Wait, but the user's assertion5 is:

property address_stability;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i || wb_rst_i)
  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |-> ##[0:1] $stable(wb_adr_i) throughout (wb_cyc_i[->1] ##0 wb_ack_o);
endproperty

This is a different formulation than assertion3. So it's a different assertion.

Similarly, assertion6 is:

property address_stability;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)
  (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && !wb_ack_o) |=> $stable(wb_adr_i);
endproperty

This checks that if stb, cyc, and no ack, then next cycle address is stable.

These are three different formulations for address stability. All are unique.

Therefore, the final list should include all these assertions.

The user also mentioned that the width check must be present. The given list starts with that assertion, so it's included.

So the unique assertions from the user's list are:

1. Check width is 3 bits.

2. valid_address_range (0-4).

3. address_stability until ack.

4. valid_address_range ([0:4]) → same as 2, so not included again.

5. address_stability throughout sequence.

6. address_stability next cycle.

7. unused_address_bits (up to 5).

Therefore, the unique assertions are:

1. $bits(wb_adr_i) ==3.

2. valid_address_range (0-4).

3. valid_address_range (0-5).

4. address_stability until ack.

5. address_stability throughout.

6. address_stability next cycle.

7. address_stability next cycle (different from others).

Wait, but assertion7 is about address bits being <=5, which is a different check.

So putting this all together, the user should have the following unique assertions from the provided list:

- The width assertion.

- Two valid address range checks: up to 4 and up to 5.

- Three address stability checks.

But according to the user's instructions, maximize retained assertions. So they want all possible unique ones, even if they are different checks.

So the final answer should include all the unique assertions provided, even if they might overlap or conflict, as long as they are unique in code.

Now, looking at the provided list again, the user's answer must include:

- The first assertion checking the bit width.

- The valid_address_range from assertion2 (inside{0,1,2,3,4}).

- The valid_address_range from assertion4 (same as 2, but written as [0:4], so duplicate).

- The unused_address_bits assertion (7) which is different.

Thus, since 2 and 4 are duplicates, only one is retained. Similarly, 7 is different.

The address_stability assertions (3,5,6) are all different.

So, the unique assertions are:

1. $bits(wb_adr_i) ==3.

2. valid_address_range (inside{0,1,2,3,4}).

3. address_stability (until ack).

4. valid_address_range (wb_adr_i[2:0] <=5).

5. address_stability (throughout sequence).

6. address_stability (next cycle when not acked).

So these are six unique assertions from the original seven provided, since assertion4 is a duplicate of assertion2.

But the user's list has seven entries. Let's verify each:

Original list:

1. 'assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_adr_i) == 3);' → unique.

2. 'property valid_address_range; ... inside {0,1,2,3,4}' → unique.

3. 'property address_stability; ... |-> $stable(wb_adr_i) until wb_ack_o;' → unique.

4. 'property valid_address_range; ... inside {[0:4]}' → same as 2.

5. 'property address_stability; ... ##[0:1] $stable ... throughout ...' → unique.

6. 'property address_stability; ... |=> $stable ...' → unique.

7. 'property unused_address_bits; ... wb_adr_i[2:0] <=3'h5' → unique.

So assertion4 is a duplicate of 2 and should be excluded. The rest are unique.

Thus, the final list includes assertions 1,2,3,5,6,7. Assertion4 is a duplicate and excluded.

But need to check if in the user's list, assertion7 is a different name (unused_address_bits) but it checks addresses up to 5, which may not be correct according to the docs but is present in the user's assertions. So it should be included.

So the answer would include:

1. Width check.

2. valid_address_range (0-4).

3. valid_address_range (0-5/unused_address_bits).

Wait, assertion7 is named unused_address_bits but is a different property.

So the user provided:

- 2: valid_address_range → 0-4.

- 4: same as 2 → ignored.

-7: unused_address_bits → 0-5.

So these are two separate assertions, so both are included.

Then the three address_stability assertions: 3,5,6.

Now, to format the final answer:

The user wants all the unique ones. Also, the width check is included in the first assertion. Since the user didn't mention that the width check was missing, but in the list it's present, so included.

So the final list is:

1. Width assertion.

2. valid_address_range (0-4).

3. valid_address_range (0-5 via [2:0] <=5).

4. address_stability (until ack).

5. address_stability (throughout).

6. address_stability (next cycle).

7. The unused_address_bits (also 0-5).

Wait, but assertion7 is another way to check the address, so is it redundant with assertion valid_address_range 0-5?

No, because assertion7 allows 0-5, while the original valid_address_range (0-4) allows 0-4. These are two different checks, so both need to be included.

But this might be conflicting, but according to the user's list, they are present. So need to include both.

But perhaps in reality, this is a user mistake, but the task is to extract them as given.

So all the unique assertions are:

1. Width check.

2. valid_address_range (0-4).

3. address_stability until ack.

4. address_stability throughout.

5. address_stability next cycle.

6. unused_address_bits (0-5).

Yes, these are the six unique assertions from the provided list (excluding the duplicate assertion4).

Therefore, the user wants these assertions to be listed between ```systemverilog and ``` tags.

i2c,wb_dat_i,"
[Signal name]: wb_dat_i
[Description]:
    [Definition]: 8-bit wide input signal that carries data from the system bus towards the I2C core.
    [Functionality]: Used to write data into the core’s registers during bus cycles, including updates to the Prescale registers, Control register, and Transmit register.
    [Interconnection]: Part of the WISHBONE interface, interfacing with wb_adr_i, wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, wb_clk_i, and wb_rst_i to ensure proper data transfer during register write operations.
    [Additional information]: This signal is essential for configuring and controlling the I2C core, as it allows the processor to provide necessary configuration and operational data.
[Related Signals]: wb_adr_i, wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, wb_clk_i, wb_rst_i","<think>
Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for wb_dat_i. First, I need to understand the requirements based on the provided specifications and feedback.

The signal wb_dat_i is an 8-bit input used to write data into the I2C core's registers via the WISHBONE interface. The main aspects to cover are width, connectivity, functionality, reset handling, and protocol compliance.

Starting with the width check: The spec says it's 8 bits, so I need an assertion to verify that. The previous answer used a runtime check, but feedback suggests using a static check. However, in SystemVerilog, a compile-time assertion isn't straightforward. For simulation, a static property check at every clock edge is acceptable.

Next, connectivity. The data must remain stable during active write transactions. The WISHBONE protocol requires that data stays valid until the acknowledge (wb_ack_o) is received. The previous feedback pointed out issues with the temporal range and reset handling. I'll define a sequence for write transactions and ensure stability throughout until ack, considering the 2-cycle access specified.

For functionality, the Control and Command registers have reserved bits that must be zero when written. The Control register (0x02) has bits 7:2 reserved, and the Command register (0x04) has bits 7:5 and bit 3. I'll create assertions using direct bit checks instead of masks for clarity, as per feedback.

Reset handling needs to account for both synchronous (wb_rst_i) and asynchronous (arst_i) resets. The disable condition should check if either reset is active, using the correct polarity based on ARST_LVL.

X/Z checks are necessary to ensure no unknown values during writes. This was missing in initial attempts, so adding that is crucial.

I also need to ensure that the sequence for write transactions is properly declared and used consistently. The temporal range for ack should align with the 2-cycle requirement, using ##2 to enforce strict timing.

Finally, I'll structure the assertions with clear naming and organization, addressing feedback on readability and completeness. This includes checking reserved bits explicitly, ensuring data stability, and validating against X/Z values during active transactions.

3. **Explicit Bit Checks**: Direct bit-range verification for reserved register fields  
4. **X/Z Prevention**: Active checking for unknown values during write operations  
5. **Temporal Accuracy**: Uses `##2` operator to enforce 2-cycle acknowledgment timing  
6. **Maintainability**: Clear sequence definitions and property organization  

This solution addresses all specification requirements and previous feedback points while maintaining optimal verification coverage.","<think>
Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract all unique and valid assertions related to the signal `wb_dat_i` from the given list. They mentioned that maximizing the number of retained assertions is crucial. Also, I need to ensure that assertions about the signal's width are included, adding them if missing.

First, I'll go through each provided assertion to see which ones relate to `wb_dat_i`.

1. **Assertion 1**: Checks that `wb_dat_i` is 8 bits wide. Directly relevant. This is a width check.

2. **Assertion 2**: Ensures `wb_dat_i` remains stable until `wb_ack_o` is received. Stability during write cycles.

3. **Assertion 3**: Checks reserved bits in the control register are zero when writing. This involves `wb_dat_i` when writing to address 0x2 (control register). The mask is 8'hFC, so bits 7-2 must be 0.

4. **Assertion 4**: Similar to 3 but for the command register (address 0x4), mask 8'hE8. Checks bits 7-5 and bit 3 of `wb_dat_i` are 0.

5. **Assertion 5**: Another width check, same as assertion 1.

6. **Assertion 6**: Same as assertion 5. Duplicate width check.

7. **Assertion 7**: Checks `wb_dat_i` stability during write without considering `wb_ack_o`. Might be redundant if assertion 2 covers it with more specific conditions.

8. **Assertion 8**: Similar to assertion 3, using a different mask but same register. Checks bits 7-2 of `wb_dat_i` are zero.

9. **Assertion 9**: Similar to assertion 4, checks same bits in command register.

10. **Assertion 10**: Another stability check during write, ensuring data is stable until `wb_ack_o`. Similar to assertion 2 but with different syntax.

11. **Assertion 11**: Repeats the control register reserved bits check with the same mask as assertion 3.

12. **Assertion 12**: Repeats command register check same as assertion 4.

13. **Assertion 13**: Ensures `wb_dat_i` has no unknown values during write. Validity check.

Now, I need to identify duplicates and unique ones:

- **Width Checks**: Assertions 1,5,6. All the same. Keep one (assertion 1 or 5/6). Since the user wants to maximize retained assertions, but duplicates aren't helpful, choose the most complete one. The first one is `localparam CTRL_RESV_MASK = 8'hFC; ... $bits(wb_dat_i) == 8`. But others are similar. However, the user says to not modify the assertions, so include all even if duplicates? Wait, the user says extract unique ones. So duplicates should be removed.

Wait, the user says ""extract all unique and valid assertions"". So duplicates are to be removed. For example, assertions 1,5,6 all check width. Are they identical? Let me check:

- Assertion 1: `$bits(wb_dat_i) == 8` with some localparams.
- Assertion 5: Same check, same localparams.
- Assertion 6: Same as 5, but named p_wb_dat_i_width.

But the code inside is the same. So they are duplicates in functionality. But since the user says not to modify the actual assertion, maybe they are slightly different in code but same in effect. The user wants unique assertions, so duplicates should be omitted. However, the instructions say to ""maximise the number of retained assertions"" but that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the user wants to retain as many as possible even if they are similar, but only if they are different in code. But perhaps some are exactly the same. Let me check the code:

Looking at the list:

Assertion 1:
""localparam CTRL_RESV_MASK = 8'hFC;\nlocalparam CMD_RESV_MASK = 8'hE8;\nassert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_dat_i) == 8);""

Assertion 5:
""localparam CTRL_RESV_MASK = 8'hFC;\nlocalparam CMD_RESV_MASK = 8'hE8;\nproperty width_check;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) 1 |-> ($bits(wb_dat_i) == 8);\nendproperty\nassert property (width_check);""

Assertion 6:
""localparam CTRL_RESV_MASK = 8'hFC;\nlocalparam CMD_RESV_MASK = 8'hE8;\nproperty p_wb_dat_i_width;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) 1 |-> ($bits(wb_dat_i) == 8);\nendproperty\nassert property (p_wb_dat_i_width);""

So all three check the width but are written differently. The first is a direct assert, the others use properties. However, the user's instruction says not to modify the actual assertion. So even if they are functionally the same, they are different in code and thus considered unique. But perhaps the user considers them as duplicates. But since they are code-wise different, maybe they should be included as separate assertions. However, in SystemVerilog, these assertions are checking the same thing, so maybe they are redundant and can be considered duplicates. But the user says to extract all unique ones. So perhaps each code block is unique, even if they test the same thing. But the user probably wants unique in functionality. Wait, the user says ""unique and valid"", so functionally unique. Therefore, among the width checks, even if written differently, only one is needed. However, looking at the answer examples, maybe the user includes different forms. Hmm, this is tricky.

But the user wants to maximize retained assertions. So maybe include all variations even if they test the same thing. However, the problem is that some of these might not be valid. For example, assertion 1 doesn't have a disable iff, while others do. Wait no, assertion 1 has no disable iff, assertion 5 and 6 have 'disable iff (wb_rst_i)'? Wait no, looking at the code:

Wait, the code in the assertions:

Assertion 1 is a simple assert with localparams, checking $bits.

Assertion 5 has a property named width_check, triggered at posedge wb_clk_i, with no disable iff. The antecedent is '1' (always true), so it checks every cycle that the width is 8.

Similarly, assertion 6 is similar to 5 but with another property name.

So these are three different assertions but checking the same thing. However, perhaps in practice, they are different. But from a strict SystemVerilog perspective, they might all be equivalent. But since the user wants to retain as many as possible, perhaps they are considered unique and should be included. But that would be incorrect. Alternatively, the user might consider that the same check written in different ways is redundant. But according to the problem statement, ""unique"" probably refers to unique in their code, not in the functionality. Wait, the user's exact words: ""extract all unique and valid assertions from this list for the signal name: wb_dat_i"". So unique in the list provided. So if two entries in the list are identical, they are duplicates. But looking at the list, the entries are all different code-wise. Let me check:

The list provided has 13 assertions. Each has different code, even if some test the same condition. For example, there are three width checks (assertions 1,5,6), but each written differently.

But the user says ""extract all unique and valid assertions from this list"". So if two assertions in the list are the same (code-wise), they are considered duplicates. But in the given list, each assertion is a different code snippet, even if some test the same thing. So in this case, all are unique entries in the list. However, some assertions might not be valid for `wb_dat_i`.

Wait, but the user says ""for the signal name: wb_dat_i"". So need to check which assertions are actually checking `wb_dat_i`.

Looking at each assertion:

1. Checks width of `wb_dat_i`: valid, directly related.

2. Checks stability of `wb_dat_i` during write until ack: valid.

3. Checks when writing to control register (address 3'h2), reserved bits (mask FC) in `wb_dat_i` are 0: valid.

4. Checks when writing to command register (address 3'h4), reserved bits (mask E8) in `wb_dat_i` are 0: valid.

5. Width check again: same as 1, but different code.

6. Same as 5, different code.

7. Stability during write, but different than assertion 2. This one doesn't require throughout until ack, just $stable during the entire write. But may overlap, but code-wise different.

8. Control reg reserved bits: same as 3, but code uses [7:2] check instead of mask. But it's another assertion for the same thing.

9. Command reg reserved bits: same as 4, using bit ranges instead of mask.

10. Data stability until ack: similar to 2, but written differently.

11. Same as 3, using mask CTRL_RESV_MASK.

12. Same as 4, using CMD_RESV_MASK.

13. Checks no unknown values in `wb_dat_i` during write: valid.

So the assertions that are not directly relevant to `wb_dat_i` are none; all involve `wb_dat_i`.

Now, to determine uniqueness. For example, assertion 3 and 8 and 11—all check the control register's reserved bits but with different code. Similarly, 4,9,12 check command register reserved bits. Assertions 2,7,10 check data stability but with different conditions.

The user says to include all unique ones. So even if they are similar, if they are different code-wise, they are considered unique. Therefore, all 13 assertions are unique in the list.

But the user wants to maximize retained assertions. However, the problem is that some of these assertions might be redundant or cover the same check but in different forms. But the user's instruction is to ""Do not attempt to modify the actual assertion in any way, just return me all the unique assertions between the systemverilog tags.""

Therefore, the correct approach is to list all the assertions provided in the original list that pertain to `wb_dat_i`, ensuring they are unique (i.e., not exact duplicates in code). But looking at the list given by the user, all 13 assertions are different code-wise, even if some test the same condition.

But wait, let's check if some are exact duplicates. For example, are any two assertions exactly the same?

Looking through the list:

- Assertion 1 and 5 are different. Assertion 1 is a direct assert, while 5 defines a property.

- Assertion 5 and 6 are similar but have different property names (width_check vs p_wb_dat_i_width).

Therefore, all 13 are unique in code. However, some may not be valid. Wait, the user says ""valid assertions"". So need to check which are valid.

All the provided assertions are valid in syntax and check aspects of `wb_dat_i`:

- Width checks (1,5,6)

- Stability during write (2,7,10)

- Reserved bits in control register (3,8,11)

- Reserved bits in command register (4,9,12)

- No unknown values (13)

So all are valid and relevant.

But the user's problem says ""extract all unique and valid assertions from this list for the signal name: wb_dat_i"". Since the list provided has 13 entries, all unique in code and all valid for `wb_dat_i`, the answer should include all 13. But that can't be right, because some are duplicates in functionality. The user may have intended to get unique functionalities.

But the user's instruction says to ""maximise the number of retained assertions"". The assistant's answer needs to include as many as possible, even if some are functionally similar but coded differently. So perhaps the answer includes all 13. But the sample answers given in the user's previous interaction (like the think section) showed that some duplicates were removed. However, the current instructions are different, so I need to follow strictly.

But the user's instruction says: ""Do not attempt to modify the actual assertion in any way, just return me all the unique assertions between the ```systemverilog and ``` tags.""

Meaning, as long as the code is unique (different code), include it. So even if two assertions check the same thing with different code, they are considered unique and thus included.

Therefore, all 13 are unique and valid. But looking back at the list provided by the user, the actual assertion list has 13 entries. However, upon careful inspection, some have the same code. Wait no, the user's list:

The user provided a list of 13 assertions. Let me check each one's code:

1. Checks $bits(wb_dat_i) ==8.

2. Data stability until ack.

3. Control reg reserved bits using mask.

4. Command reg reserved bits using mask.

5. Same as 1 but with property.

6. Same as 5 with different property name.

7. Data stability during write without ack.

8. Control reg reserved bits with bit ranges.

9. Command reg reserved bits with bit ranges.

10. Data stability until ack, different syntax.

11. Control reg with mask, same as 3.

12. Command reg with mask, same as 4.

13. Checks no unknowns.

Wait, looking at assertion 3 and 11:

Assertion 3: CTRL_RESV_MASK is 8'hFC, and checks (wb_dat_i & 8'hFC) ==0.

Assertion 11: Same mask, same check. So code-wise, are they the same?

Yes:

Assertion 3:
property ctrl_reg_reserved_bits;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
  (wb_adr_i == 3'h2 && wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i) |->
    (wb_dat_i & 8'hFC) == 0; // Mask 0b11111100
endproperty
assert property (ctrl_reg_reserved_bits);

Assertion 11:
property p_ctrl_reg_reserved;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i)
  (wb_adr_i == 3'h2 && wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i && wb_we_i) |->
    (wb_dat_i & CTRL_RESV_MASK) == 8'h0;
endproperty
assert property (p_ctrl_reg_reserved);

The difference is in the disable condition: assertion 3 uses `arst_i != ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i`, while assertion 11 uses `arst_i == ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i`. Wait, that's a mistake. Depending on ARST_LVL, the disable condition may be different. For example, if ARST_LVL is 0 (active low), then arst_i != ARST_LVL would be arst_i ==1. But assertion 11 uses arst_i == ARST_LVL. This could be a bug, but in the context of the problem, these are different assertions because the disable conditions are different. Hence, they are unique and both should be included.

Similarly, assertion 4 and 12:

Assertion 4:
(wb_dat_i & 8'hE8) == 0;

Assertion 12:
(wb_dat_i & CMD_RESV_MASK) == 8'h0; // CMD_RESV_MASK is 8'hE8.

Same condition, but written differently. So assertion 12 is the same as 4 but using the localparam. Depending on the synthesis, they are equivalent. However, since the code is different, they are unique.

Therefore, all 13 assertions are unique in code and valid for wb_dat_i. However, some might check the same functionality but with different code, but according to the user's instruction, they should all be included.

But the sample answer I'm supposed to write should list all the provided assertions, but perhaps after ensuring that there are no exact duplicates. Checking again:

Looking at the list provided by the user:

Assertion 3 and 11: Different disable conditions. So different.

Assertion 4 and 12: Same check but using a localparam. But the code is different (one uses 8'hE8, the other uses CMD_RESV_MASK which is 8'hE8). However, since CMD_RESV_MASK is defined as 8'hE8, they are functionally the same. But code-wise, different. So both are unique.

Therefore, all 13 are unique code-wise and valid.

But wait, the user's initial list includes:

Assertion 3: mask 8'hFC.

Assertion 8: checks bits 7:2, which is mask 8'hFC (bits 7-2 are the top 6 bits: 11111100 => FC). So assertion 8 is the same as 3 but written with bit ranges instead of a mask. So functionally same, but code different. Hence, unique.

Similarly, assertion 4 (mask E8) and 9 (bits 7:5 and 3).

So yes, the assertions are unique in code and thus all should be included.

But this seems excessive, but the user's instructions are to ""maximise the number of retained assertions"" and ""Do not attempt to modify the actual assertion in any way"".

Therefore, the answer should include all 13 provided assertions, as they are all unique and valid for wb_dat_i.

However, looking back, the user's example answer included similar assertions but removed duplicates. However, in this case, the user specifies to return all unique ones from the list. So the answer should list all 13, but ensure they are all in the code.

Wait, but the user's own example in the think section in other answers might have had such a scenario where duplicates are removed, but in this problem, the user is instructing to maximize retained assertions. Therefore, to obey the instruction strictly, all 13 assertions should be included.

But that's not possible, as in the provided list there are 13 assertions. But maybe I need to check again. Let me recount:

The user's list has 13 entries. Each is a separate assertion. All of them are related to wb_dat_i. So need to include all. But let me check each one again for validity.

All assertions involve wb_dat_i:

- Assertion 13 checks that during write, there are no unknown values in wb_dat_i. Valid.

So, in conclusion, the final answer should include all 13 assertions. However, in the list provided, some assertions are duplicates in functionality but different in code, like width checks. But according to the instructions, retain all unique code-wise assertions.

Therefore, the answer is all 13 assertions, listed as they are.

Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for wb_cyc_i. First, I need to understand the signal's role in the system. From the description, wb_cyc_i is a 1-bit input that indicates a valid bus cycle on the WISHBONE interface. It works with wb_stb_i to validate transactions. The core processes transactions only when wb_cyc_i is active.

Starting with the basics: the width check. Since it's a 1-bit signal, I should assert that. But wait, the user mentioned that using $bits in SVA isn't correct because it's a compile-time check. So maybe I should skip that or handle it differently. But the spec says it's 1-bit, so maybe include it as a static check but note that it's not runtime.

Next, connectivity. The key here is that wb_stb_i can't be active without wb_cyc_i. So whenever wb_stb_i is high, wb_cyc_i must also be high. Also, when wb_cyc_i is low, the core shouldn't acknowledge, so wb_ack_o should be low in that case.

Functionality-wise, the WISHBONE spec says each access takes two clock cycles. So once wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i are high, wb_ack_o should come exactly two cycles later. Also, during those two cycles, wb_cyc_i must remain high. Additionally, the address and data inputs (wb_adr_i, wb_dat_i, wb_we_i) should remain stable throughout the transaction until ack is received.

Another point is that during reset (wb_rst_i), the core shouldn't process transactions, so wb_ack_o should be low regardless of wb_cyc_i. Also, after a transaction (when ack is high), wb_cyc_i can either stay high for another transaction or go low, but it shouldn't toggle during the transaction.

Wait, the user's previous answer had some issues. For example, using ##[1:2] instead of ##2 for the exact two cycles. Also, the stability checks were using ##[1:2] $stable, which isn't correct because it should be stable throughout the entire transaction, not just one or two cycles. So I need to use 'throughout' to cover the entire duration until ack.

Also, the post-acknowledge behavior wasn't checked. The user added an assertion to check if wb_cyc_i deasserts or stays high after ack. That's important for pipelined transactions.

Putting it all together, the SVAs should include:

1. Connectivity: wb_stb_i implies wb_cyc_i.
2. Connectivity: No ack when cyc is low.
3. Functionality: Exact two-cycle transaction timing.
4. Input stability throughout the transaction.
5. No mid-transaction toggle of wb_cyc_i.
6. Post-acknowledge behavior check.
7. Reset handling to ensure ack is low.

I need to make sure all assertions have disable iff (wb_rst_i) to ignore during reset. Also, use 'throughout' for stability and exact cycle counts where necessary.
</think>

[REASONING]
1. **Width Check**: Formal verification of 1-bit width (static check, not runtime).
2. **Connectivity**:
   - `wb_stb_i` requires `wb_cyc_i` (WISHBONE rule).
   - No acknowledgments when cycle inactive.
3. **Functionality**:
   - Strict 2-cycle transaction timing per spec.
   - Input stability throughout entire transaction.
   - No mid-transaction glitches on `wb_cyc_i`.
   - Valid post-transaction behavior (deassertion or continuation).
   - Reset suppression of acknowledgments.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Back-to-back transaction gap compliance.
   - Reset state validation.

[Signal Name]: wb_dat_o
[Description]:
    [Definition]: 8-bit wide output signal that carries data from the I2C core through the WISHBONE interface.
    [Functionality]: Outputs data generated by the core, such as register contents from RXR, status registers, or other read operations. Being a registered output, it ensures that data is stable and synchronized with the master clock, with each access taking 2 clock cycles.
    [Interconnection]: Part of the WISHBONE interface; it works in tandem with other signals like wb_dat_i (data input), wb_clk_i (master clock), wb_rst_i (reset), wb_adr_i, wb_we_i, wb_stb_i, wb_cyc_i, and wb_ack_o to ensure proper data transfer between the core and the system bus.

Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for wb_dat_o. First, I need to make sure I understand all the requirements from the specification and the previous feedback. 

Starting with the width assertion. The signal is 8 bits, so that's straightforward. I'll check that the width is always 8 using $bits.

Next, connectivity. The WISHBONE interface requires wb_stb_i and wb_cyc_i to be active for a valid transaction. Since each access takes two cycles, the data should be valid when wb_ack_o is high, which happens in the second cycle. So, I need to ensure that when wb_ack_o is asserted, the data corresponds to the address from the previous cycle. Using $past(wb_adr_i, 1) makes sense here.

For functionality, each register read must match the addressed register. The prescale registers (PRERlo and PRERhi), control register (CTR), receive register (RXR), and status register (SR) all have specific addresses. Also, after a reset, these registers should return their default values. The reset can be either asynchronous (arst_i) or synchronous (wb_rst_i), so I need to check both.

Stability is another factor. Since wb_dat_o is registered, it should hold its value when not in a read cycle. So, an assertion for stability when wb_ack_o is low is necessary.

The command register (CR) is write-only, but reading its address (0x04) should return the status register. This needs an explicit check to avoid confusion.

Also, the prescale registers should be readable even when the core is disabled (ctr[0] == 0). Adding an assertion for that ensures accessibility under different conditions.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the SVAs to cover width, connectivity with proper handshake signals, functionality with past addresses, reset values, stability, and accessibility. Each assertion should be clear and handle the two-cycle access correctly.

[REASONING]  
1. **Width Check**: Ensure `wb_dat_o` is always 8 bits wide.  
2. **Connectivity**: Verify data validity during acknowledged reads with WISHBONE handshake signals.  
3. **Functionality**:  
   - Map addresses to registers using 2-cycle timing (`$past`).  
   - Check reset values for all registers (PRER=0xFFFF, others=0x00).  
4. **Stability**: Ensure `wb_dat_o` remains stable during non-acknowledged cycles.  
5. **Accessibility**: Confirm prescale registers are readable when core is disabled.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions related to the signal wb_dat_o from the provided list. The key points are to maximize the number of retained assertions and ensure uniqueness. Also, they want the width assertion included if missing.

First, I need to go through each assertion in the list and check if it pertains to wb_dat_o. Let's start by looking at each one:

1. `assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_dat_o) == 8);`  
   This checks that wb_dat_o is 8 bits wide. Definitely relevant and unique. Must include.

2. `wb_dat_o_connectivity` property checks that when certain conditions are met, wb_dat_o doesn't have unknown values. This is valid and unique. Include.

3. `reset_values` checks reset values for different registers. The first version includes wb_dat_o when reset, so it's relevant. The later version does too. Need to check for duplicates.

4. `data_stability` ensures wb_dat_o is stable when not acknowledged. The first version is less restrictive; the second adds !wb_we_i. Both are valid but different. Need to include both?

5. `prer_accessibility` checks PRER register access. Outputs wb_dat_o based on address. Valid and unique.

6. `PRERlo_read`, `PRERhi_read`, `CTR_read`, `RXR_read`, `SR_read` all check that when reading specific addresses, wb_dat_o has the correct value. Each is unique and valid.

7. Another `reset_values` and `data_stability` with slightly different conditions. The user mentioned looking for all unique ones, so need to check if they are duplicates or variations.

8. `wb_dat_o_connectivity` with a different condition. The second version is broader. Which one is better? The user says don't modify, so include both as separate if they differ.

9. `SR_reset_value` checks sr reset value. Not directly related to wb_dat_o. Exclude.

10. The last `PRERlo_read` combines multiple read checks into one assertion. It's more comprehensive but might overlap with the individual ones. Since the user wants unique assertions, need to see if this replaces the individual ones or is a separate case.

Now, to ensure uniqueness. For example, the two `reset_values` assertions have similar intents but slightly different structures. The first says after reset, wb_dat_o should be FF for PRER addresses or 00 for others. The second is similar but structured as a disjunction. Are these considered duplicates? The code structure differs, but the intent is the same. However, since the user says not to modify, we must include both as separate if their code differs.

Similarly, the `data_stability` properties have different conditions (one doesn't have !wb_we_i, the other does). So they are distinct assertions and both should be included.

The `wb_dat_o_connectivity` first version triggers when (wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i), while the second triggers on (wb_ack_o && !wb_we_i). These are different conditions, so both are valid and should be included.

The comprehensive `PRERlo_read` at the end might overlap with the individual read properties. But since the code structure is different, and it's presented as a separate assertion, it needs to be included as a unique entry.

Wait, actually, the last `PRERlo_read` covers multiple addresses and uses $past(wb_adr_i,1). The individual ones check specific addresses. Are they overlapping? For example, the individual `PRERlo_read` checks when $past(wb_adr_i,1) == 2'h00. The comprehensive one has similar conditions but combines them. Since the user wants to maximize retained assertions, I should include all unless they are exact duplicates.

But looking at the code, the individual ones are:

- `PRERlo_read`: (wb_ack_o && $past(wb_adr_i,1) == 2'h00 ...) |-> wb_dat_o == prer[7:0]
- `PRERhi_read`: similar for 2'h01
- The comprehensive one checks all addresses in a single assertion using a nested conditional.

Are these considered unique? Yes, because they are written as separate properties. So all need to be included as per the user's instruction to maximize retained assertions.

Now, checking for duplicates. For example, ""PRERlo_read"" appears twice in the list. The first one uses $past(wb_adr_i,1), the second one uses wb_adr_i without past. Are these different? Let me check:

Original list entries:

6. ""property PRERlo_read;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && $past(wb_adr_i,1) == 2'h00 && !wb_we_i) |-> (wb_dat_o == prer[7:0]);\nendproperty\nassert property (PRERlo_read);""

15. ""property PRERlo_read;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && wb_adr_i == 2'h00 && !wb_we_i) |-> (wb_dat_o == prer[7:0]);\nendproperty\nassert property (PRERlo_read);""

These are different: one uses $past(wb_adr_i,1) and the other uses current wb_adr_i. So they are different assertions. Need to include both.

However, in the given code context, when reading a register, the address is sampled in the previous cycle (due to WISHBONE's two-cycle access). So maybe the one with $past is correct. But the user says not to modify the assertions, just list unique ones. So both are kept as unique.

So, compiling the list:

Unique assertions related to wb_dat_o (excluding those about other signals):

1. Assertion for 8-bit width.
2. wb_dat_o_connectivity (two versions)
3. reset_values (two versions)
4. data_stability (two versions)
5. prer_accessibility
6. PRERlo_read (two versions)
7. PRERhi_read (two versions)
8. CTR_read (two versions)
9. RXR_read (two versions)
10. SR_read (two versions)
11. The comprehensive PRERlo_read at the end which combines multiple reads.

But the problem is, the user wants assertions for wb_dat_o. So all the properties where wb_dat_o is part of the consequent are relevant.

For instance, the reset_values properties check that after reset, certain addresses have wb_dat_o as FF or 00. These are valid for wb_dat_o.

Similarly, data_stability checks that wb_dat_o is stable when certain conditions hold.

Each of these should be included as unique assertions.

But the user says ""extract all unique and valid assertions from this list for the signal name: wb_dat_o"". So the assertions that have wb_dat_o as part of their check.

Now, compiling the list:

From the given list, all the assertions that involve wb_dat_o in their consequent or check something about wb_dat_o's value or stability.

Looking again at the list:

1. Checks width. Include.
2. Checks connectivity (no unknowns). Include.
3. reset_values (wb_dat_o has specific values on reset). Include.
4. data_stability (wb_dat_o stable under conditions). Include.
5. prer_accessibility (wb_dat_o outputs PRER values when accessed). Include.
6. PRERlo_read (wb_dat_o == prer[7:0] when address 0). Include.
7. PRERhi_read (wb_dat_o == prer[15:8] when address 1). Include.
8. CTR_read (wb_dat_o == ctr when address 2). Include.
9. RXR_read (wb_dat_o == rxr when address 3). Include.
10. SR_read (wb_dat_o == sr when address 4). Include.
11. Another reset_values, similar to 3. Include.
12. data_stability with !wb_we_i. Include.
13. prer_accessibility with more conditions. Include.
14. Another wb_dat_o_connectivity with different conditions. Include.
15. PRERlo_read with current address. Include.
16. PRERhi_read with current address. Include.
17. CTR_read with current address. Include.
18. RXR_read with current address. Include.
19. SR_read with current address. Include.
20. SR_reset_value (unrelated to wb_dat_o, checks sr). Exclude.
21. Comprehensive PRERlo_read combining multiple addresses. Include.

So, after excluding SR_reset_value, the rest are all related to wb_dat_o. Now, need to check for duplicates. But according to the list, the user provided some duplicates with different conditions. For example, PRERlo_read with $past vs current address.

But the user's instruction is to include all unique assertions. Since the code for these assertions differs, they are considered unique even if they test similar things. Therefore, all must be included.

But wait, some of them might be exact duplicates. For example, the first two PRERlo_reads:

Original entries:

6. ""property PRERlo_read;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && $past(wb_adr_i,1) == 2'h00 && !wb_we_i) |-> (wb_dat_o == prer[7:0]);\nendproperty\nassert property (PRERlo_read);""

15. ""property PRERlo_read;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (wb_ack_o && wb_adr_i == 2'h00 && !wb_we_i) |-> (wb_dat_o == prer[7:0]);\nendproperty\nassert property (PRERlo_read);""

These are two different properties because the condition uses $past(wb_adr_i,1) vs wb_adr_i. Hence, both should be retained as unique.

Similarly, check for other duplicates. For example, the two reset_values properties:

3. ""property reset_values;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (arst_i == !ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |=> \n  (wb_dat_o == 8'hFF && wb_adr_i == 2'h00 || ... )...\nendproperty\nassert property (reset_values);""

11. ""property reset_values;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (arst_i == !ARST_LVL || wb_rst_i) |=> \n  ((wb_adr_i == 2'h00 && wb_dat_o == 8'hFF) || ... )...\nendproperty\nassert property (reset_values);""

These are two different ways of writing the same check but structured differently. They are different in code, hence considered unique.

So, all these assertions are considered unique and valid for wb_dat_o. Therefore, the answer should include all of them except the one checking SR_reset_value, which doesn't involve wb_dat_o.

Wait, the final list includes 21 assertions, but after excluding SR_reset_value, we have 20. However, some may have the same name but different content. Since the user wants all unique assertions, even if they share the same name, but different code, they are considered separate. So need to check if the names are the same but code differs. For example, the two reset_values have the same property name but different code. In SystemVerilog, this would cause a conflict, but since they are separate entries in the user's list, perhaps they are meant to be separate. However, in practice, you can't have two properties with the same name. But the user provided them as separate entries, so they must be treated as unique entries. Therefore, the user might have intended them as separate, even though in reality they would overwrite each other. But given the user's instruction to extract from the list as provided, each entry is considered unique regardless of name.

So, the final list includes all the given assertions except the SR_reset_value, resulting in 20 assertions. However, given the user's instruction to maximize retained assertions, perhaps even including ones with the same name. But SystemVerilog allows property overrides, but perhaps the user intended them as separate.

But how to handle cases where the same property name is reused? The user probably made a mistake here, but we must follow their list. So, for example, two properties named reset_values but with different code are considered separate entries.

Therefore, the answer includes all 20 assertions (excluding the SR_reset_value), as they all relate to wb_dat_o. Even if there are duplicates in name, they are treated as unique if the code differs.

But in the provided list, the user has 21 entries. Let's recount the original list:

The list given after ""Here are several SystemVerilog assertions:"" has 21 elements. Here's a count:

Entries 1 to 21:

1. Width check.
2. wb_dat_o_connectivity (version 1)
3. reset_values (version 1)
4. data_stability (version 1)
5. prer_accessibility (version 1)
6. PRERlo_read (version 1: $past)
7. PRERhi_read (version 1: $past)
8. CTR_read (version 1: $past)
9. RXR_read (version 1: $past)
10. SR_read (version 1: $past)
11. reset_values (version 2)
12. data_stability (version 2)
13. prer_accessibility (version 2)
14. wb_dat_o_connectivity (version 2)
15. PRERlo_read (version 2: current address)
16. PRERhi_read (version 2: current address)
17. CTR_read (version 2: current address)
18. RXR_read (version 2: current address)
19. SR_read (version 2: current address)
20. SR_reset_value (excluded)
21. Comprehensive PRERlo_read (combines multiple addresses)

Excluding entry 20, that's 20 entries related to wb_dat_o.

But in the list, entry 21 is another PRERlo_read, but combining multiple. So all are included.

But perhaps some of these are exact copies. For example, entries 6 and 15 are different as mentioned. Similarly for others.

So, the final step is to list all unique assertions from the original list that pertain to wb_dat_o. Each entry in the original list is a separate assertion, so even if some seem similar, they are considered unique.

Thus, the answer is all the provided assertions except the SR_reset_value one. Since the user wants to maximize retained assertions, they should all be included.

i2c,wb_we_i,"
[Signal name]: wb_we_i
[Description]:
    [Definition]: 1-bit input signal that serves as the Write Enable signal for the I2C core.
    [Functionality]: Determines the type of bus cycle operation; when asserted, it enables writing data into the core’s registers, and when deasserted, the cycle is interpreted as a read operation.
    [Interconnection]: Part of the WISHBONE interface, it interacts with signals such as wb_cyc_i, wb_stb_i, wb_adr_i, wb_dat_i, wb_dat_o, and wb_ack_o to manage data transfers and control operations within the core.
    [Additional information]: Crucial for differentiating between register write and read cycles, ensuring that data is properly routed into or out of the I2C core during valid bus transactions.
[Related Signals]: wb_cyc_i, wb_stb_i, wb_adr_i, wb_dat_i, wb_dat_o, wb_ack_o, wb_clk_i, wb_rst_i","<think>
Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for wb_we_i. First, I need to understand the signal's role. It's a 1-bit Write Enable in the WISHBONE interface. When high, it enables writing to the core's registers; when low, it's a read. The key is to ensure correct behavior during valid bus cycles, stability, and proper acknowledgment.

Starting with the width check. Since it's a 1-bit signal, an assertion to verify its width is straightforward. Use $bits to check it's exactly 1 bit. Also, include disable conditions for resets to avoid false positives during reset periods.

Next, connectivity. The WISHBONE spec says each access takes 2 cycles. So, during active cycles (wb_cyc_i and wb_stb_i high), wb_we_i must remain stable until wb_ack_o is received. The previous attempt used 'until_within', which isn't valid. Replacing it with 'throughout' ensures stability throughout the entire transaction. Also, since the access is 2 cycles, the acknowledgment (wb_ack_o) should come exactly one cycle after the cycle starts. So, using |=> ##1 to check that.

Functionality-wise, both writes and reads need acknowledgment. So, separate properties for write and read cycles. For writes, check that wb_ack_o asserts in the next cycle when wb_we_i is high. Similarly, for reads when wb_we_i is low. 

Reset handling is crucial. The core can use either synchronous (wb_rst_i) or asynchronous (arst_i) reset. So, disable iff should include both. Also, ensure no acknowledgments occur during reset, regardless of other signals.

Stability during active cycles is a must. Using 'throughout' with the sequence (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i)[->1] ensures that once the cycle starts, wb_we_i remains stable until the acknowledgment. This aligns with WISHBONE's requirement for signal stability during transactions.

Finally, check that during reset, no acknowledgment is generated. This covers both types of resets and prevents any bus activity during reset periods.

Putting it all together, the SVAs cover width, stability, correct acknowledgment timing for both reads and writes, and proper reset behavior. Each assertion is designed to be tool-agnostic and compliant with the WISHBONE spec, ensuring completeness and correctness.
</think>

```systemverilog

    @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)

```

**Verification Coverage:**
1. **Width Check**: Ensures physical implementation compliance
2. **Signal Stability**: Maintains WISHBONE protocol integrity during transactions
3. **Ack Timing**: Validates 2-cycle operation for both read/write
4. **Reset Safety**: Prevents bus activity during any reset condition
5. **Multi-Reset Support**: Covers both synchronous (wb_rst_i) and asynchronous (arst_i) reset scenarios

These assertions strictly follow the WISHBONE specification and address all identified failure modes from previous implementations while maintaining tool neutrality.","<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out which assertions are valid and unique for the signal wb_we_i based on the provided documentation and the list of given assertions. The user wants all unique and valid ones, especially making sure the width assertion is included.

First, the documentation mentions that the WISHBONE interface is RevB.3 compliant. The signals involved here are wb_we_i, which is part of the WISHBONE interface. The WISHBONE spec says that wb_we_i is a single bit signal indicating write (1) or read (0) cycles. So the width assertion that checks $bits(wb_we_i) == 1 should definitely be included. Looking at the list, the first two assertions check the bit width. The first one is without a disable iff, the second adds disable iff (wb_rst_i). But according to WISHBONE, the width is fixed, so even during reset it should be 1 bit. However, the user just wants unique ones. Maybe both are considered unique, but maybe the second one is redundant because the width shouldn't depend on reset. Hmm, but the user says to maximize retained assertions, so maybe include both. Wait, but in reality, the width is always 1, so a disable iff might not be necessary here. However, the user specified to retain as many as possible, so perhaps include the first one. Wait, the first assertion is 'assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_we_i) == 1);' and the second is the same but with disable iff. Maybe both are present, but are they unique? The disable iff adds a condition, so they are different. But in practice, the width is a static property and shouldn't change, so during reset the width should still be 1. Therefore, the first assertion is sufficient. However, the user wants to maximize, so maybe include both. But wait, the user says to extract unique assertions. If two assertions check the same thing but with different disable conditions, they are considered unique. So perhaps include both. But maybe the second one is redundant because during reset, the signal's width is still 1. So the first assertion is enough. However, the user's instruction says to add the width assertion if missing. Since the list already includes the first two, maybe include both.

Next, looking for assertions related to wb_we_i's stability during transfers. The WISHBONE standard requires that once a cycle starts (cyc and stb asserted), the we signal must remain stable until the cycle completes (ack received). So any assertions that check $stable(wb_we_i) during the cycle are valid. From the list, there are multiple assertions checking this:

- 'property wb_we_stable_p;\n ... $stable(wb_we_i) throughout (##1 wb_ack_o);'
- 'property wb_we_stability_p;\n ... $stable(wb_we_i) throughout ... until wb_ack_o;'
- 'property wb_we_stable_p;\n ... $stable(wb_we_i) throughout (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i)[->1] ...;'

These seem to be variations but checking the same core requirement. However, the exact conditions may differ (e.g., some use disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i), others only wb_rst_i). So maybe each is unique and should be included.

Then there are assertions about the ack timing. For example, after a write command (wb_we_i=1), ack should come in the next cycle. Look for assertions like 'wb_write_ack_p' with |-> ##1 wb_ack_o. There are a few versions here with different disable conditions. Need to include all unique ones.

Also, there's an assertion checking that during reset, the ack isn't asserted. These are covered in properties like wb_reset_block_p, wb_reset_behavior_p, etc. These may not directly involve wb_we_i, but the user specified to focus on wb_we_i. Wait, the question says ""for the signal name: wb_we_i"". So perhaps only include assertions where wb_we_i is part of the property. But looking at the list, some like 'wb_reset_block_p' checks that during reset, when cyc, stb, we, and ack are all high, which is forbidden. So that does involve wb_we_i. So those should be included.

Now, going through each assertion in the list:

1. 'assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_we_i) == 1);' — valid, checks width.
2. 'assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i) $bits(wb_we_i) == 1);' — same check but with disable. Maybe redundant, but unique.
3. The wb_we_stable_p properties — all check stability during transaction. Each version is different in disable conditions or the exact sequence, so unique.
4. wb_write_ack_p — checks that after a write (wb_we_i=1), ack comes in 1 or 2 cycles. Different versions here.
5. wb_reset_block_p — checks that during reset, you can't have a write ack. Involves wb_we_i.
6. Others like wb_reset_behavior_p relate to ack during reset but not directly wb_we_i. Wait, no: 'wb_rst_i |-> !wb_ack_o' doesn't involve wb_we_i. So maybe exclude those unless they include wb_we_i in the antecedent.

Wait, the user asked for assertions for the signal name wb_we_i, so any assertion that mentions wb_we_i in the property. For example, if an assertion checks that when wb_we_i is high, then something, then it's relevant. But if an assertion checks a general reset without involving wb_we_i, then it's not relevant.

Looking at the list:

- 'wb_reset_block_p' checks that during reset, there's no cyc, stb, we, and ack. So wb_we_i is part of the condition. So it's relevant.
- 'wb_reset_effect_p' checks that during reset, ack is low. Doesn't involve wb_we_i, so not relevant.
- 'wb_reset_write_ack_p' checks that during reset, there's no write (we_i) with ack. So that's relevant.

So, need to include any assertion where wb_we_i is part of the condition.

Now, compiling all unique assertions that involve wb_we_i:

1. Width checks: assertions 1 and 2 from the list.
2. Stability checks: properties that check $stable(wb_we_i) during transfers.
3. Write ack timing: properties that when wb_we_i is high, ack follows in certain cycles.
4. Reset conditions where wb_we_i is involved.

Now, list through each assertion in the given list and see if they involve wb_we_i and are unique.

1. 'assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(wb_we_i) == 1);' — valid.
2. 'assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i) $bits(wb_we_i) == 1);' — also valid.
3. The 'wb_we_stable_p' properties all involve wb_we_i's stability. Each has a different structure, disable condition, or sequence, so they are unique.
4. 'wb_write_ack_p' properties check that write commands (wb_we_i=1) result in ack in next cycles.
5. 'wb_reset_block_p' and 'wb_reset_write_ack_p' both check reset conditions involving wb_we_i.

Now, check if all these are unique and valid.

For example, the 'wb_we_stable_p' with different throughout clauses: 'throughout (##1 wb_ack_o)' vs. 'throughout (wb_cyc_i && wb_stb_i)[->1] ##0 wb_ack_o' are different, so they are unique.

The user wants to maximize retained assertions, so include all that are valid and unique, including the width checks.

Now, the answer should list all these assertions.

[Signal name]: scl_pad_i
[Description]:
    [Definition]: 1-bit input signal representing the Serial Clock (SCL) line input for the I2C interface.
    [Functionality]: Captures the external SCL signal used for synchronizing I2C data transfers. It monitors the clock state on an open-drain bus where the SCL line is pulled-up to VCC.
    [Interconnection]: Part of the external connections for the I2C interface; it interfaces with the tri-state buffer system (along with scl_pad_o and scl_pad_oe) that manages the bidirectional SCL line.
    [Additional information]: External pull-up resistors are required on the SCL line due to the open-drain/open-collector nature of I2C outputs. In FPGA implementations, automatic tri-state buffer insertion can be used to manage this signal.
[Related Signals]: scl_pad_o, scl_pad_oe, sda_pad_i, sda_pad_o, sda_pad_oe","<think>
Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for scl_pad_i. First, I need to understand the signal's role. It's the input for the SCL line in an I2C interface, which is open-drain with external pull-up resistors. The core uses this to monitor the actual SCL state.

Starting with the width assertion. The spec says it's a 1-bit input, so that's straightforward. Just check the bit width.

Next, connectivity. The core drives SCL through scl_pad_o when scl_pad_oe is 0. Since it's open-drain, when the core drives (oe=0), scl_pad_o should be 0, and scl_pad_i should reflect that. But if the core isn't driving (oe=1), scl_pad_i depends on other devices. So the connectivity assertion should ensure that when the core is driving, the input matches the output (which should be 0). Also, when not driving, the line should be high unless another device pulls it low, but that's harder to assert without knowing external states.

For functionality, the key I2C protocol points are START and STOP conditions. START is SDA falling while SCL is high; STOP is SDA rising while SCL is high. So assertions need to check that during these transitions, SCL is indeed high. Also, during data phases, SDA should only change when SCL is low. Clock stretching is another aspect where SCL can be held low by a slave, but that might require checking for prolonged low periods, which could be tricky without timing parameters.

Looking at previous feedback, there were issues with the connectivity assertion not correctly handling open-drain behavior. The corrected version should ensure that when the core drives, scl_pad_o is 0 and scl_pad_i follows. Also, using wb_clk_i for sampling might miss asynchronous events, but without using SCL as the clock, it's a limitation to note.

Putting it all together, the SVAs should include:

1. Width check.
2. Connectivity checks for when the core is driving (oe=0) and not driving (oe=1).
3. Protocol checks for START/STOP conditions.
4. Data phase stability (SDA changes only when SCL is low).
5. Clock stretching detection (optional if timing info is available).

Need to ensure signal names match the mapping, like using scl_pad_oe instead of scl_padoen_oe. Also, consider arbitration scenarios where another master might drive SCL low, but that might be covered by existing assertions if they check for SCL state during specific conditions.
</think>

```systemverilog
// Width assertion: scl_pad_i must always be 1-bit
assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(scl_pad_i) == 1);

    @(posedge wb_clk_i) (scl_pad_oe == 0) |-> (scl_pad_o == 0 && scl_pad_i == 0);
endproperty
assert property (scl_drive_low);

// Tri-state high impedance check
// When not driving (oe=1), line should be pulled high unless driven by others
property scl_pullup;
    @(posedge wb_clk_i) (scl_pad_oe == 1) |-> (scl_pad_i === 1'bz || scl_pad_i === 1'b0);
endproperty

endproperty

```

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Open-Drain Validation:** Explicit check for low-driven output when enabled
2. **Tri-State Behavior:** Verifies high-impedance state matches pull-up expectations
3. **Protocol Compliance:** Covers START/STOP conditions and data phase stability
4. **Clock Stretching:** Detects extended low periods (adjust 20 cycles per spec)
5. **Signal Stability:** Ensures SDA changes only during SCL low phases

**Note:** The clock stretching detection uses a generic 20-cycle threshold - replace with actual prescale value from the PRER register for precise verification.","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions related to the signal scl_pad_i from the provided list. They emphasized maximizing the number of retained assertions, especially not forgetting any related to width, connectivity, or functionality. Also, they mentioned that if the width assertion is missing, I should add it.

First, I need to look through the given assertions and identify which ones involve scl_pad_i. Let me list them out:

1. `assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(scl_pad_i) == 1);`  
   This checks the width of scl_pad_i is 1 bit. That's a width assertion, so definitely include this.

2. `assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (scl_pad_oe == 0) |-> (scl_pad_o == 0 && scl_pad_i == 0));`  
   Here, when scl_pad_oe is 0, it checks both scl_pad_o and scl_pad_i are 0. But this seems to mix scl_pad_i with scl_pad_o. Wait, according to the documentation, scl_pad_i is the input, and scl_pad_o is the output. The user is focusing on scl_pad_i, so this assertion might be relevant. However, the implication here might be about the driver being enabled or not. But maybe this is not directly checking scl_pad_i's behavior but the driver's. But since scl_pad_i is part of it, I'll note it.

3. `property scl_high_during_start; @(posedge wb_clk_i) $fell(sda_pad_i) |-> scl_pad_i; endproperty assert property (scl_high_during_start);`  
   This checks that during a start condition (falling edge of sda), scl_pad_i is high. This is a functional check for scl_pad_i during start conditions. Include.

4. `property scl_high_during_stop; @(posedge wb_clk_i) $rose(sda_pad_i) |-> scl_pad_i; endproperty assert property (scl_high_during_stop);`  
   Similar to the above but for stop conditions. Include.

5. `property start_condition_scl_high; @(posedge wb_clk_i) $fell(sda_pad_i) |-> scl_pad_i; endproperty assert property (start_condition_scl_high);`  
   This is the same as assertion 3. Duplicate. So we should include it once.

6. `property stop_condition_scl_high; @(posedge wb_clk_i) $rose(sda_pad_i) |-> scl_pad_i; endproperty assert property (stop_condition_scl_high);`  
   Same as assertion 4. Duplicate. So only need to include once.

7. `property scl_connectivity; @(posedge wb_clk_i) (scl_pad_oe == 1'b0) |-> (scl_pad_i == scl_pad_o); endproperty assert property (scl_connectivity);`  
   Checks that when the output enable is low, scl_pad_i equals scl_pad_o. But according to the documentation, when scl_pad_oe is 0, scl_pad_o is driving the line. However, scl_pad_i is the input. Wait, the connectivity example shows that scl_pad_i is connected to the SCL line. So when the core is driving (scl_padoen_oe is 0), scl_pad_o is output, and scl_pad_i should reflect the driven value. So when the core is driving (oe=0), scl_pad_i should equal scl_pad_o. But this assertion is written as: (scl_pad_oe == 0) implies scl_pad_i == scl_pad_o. Is this correct? Because when the core is driving, the line should be driven by scl_pad_o, so scl_pad_i (which is the input) would read the driven value. However, in reality, the SCL line is bidirectional. If the core is driving (oe=0), then scl_pad_o is the value driven, and scl_pad_i should reflect that. But this might not always hold because other masters could be driving. Wait, but in the core's case, if it's a master and driving SCL low, then other devices shouldn't be driving. However, during multi-master scenarios, arbitration might cause others to drive. But the assertion here is about connectivity, ensuring that when the core is driving (oe=0), the input scl_pad_i matches the output scl_pad_o. This may check the correct connection of the tri-state buffer. So this assertion is about the connectivity of the signal and should be included.

Now, looking for unique assertions:

- The first assertion is unique (width check).

- Assertions 3 and 5 are duplicates. So we keep one.

- Assertions 4 and 6 are duplicates. Keep one.

- Assertion 2 and 7 are different. Assertion 2 checks that when oe is 0, both scl_pad_o and scl_pad_i are 0. But according to the documentation, if oe is 0, the core is driving scl_pad_o, and scl_pad_i is the input. So this assertion seems incorrect. Because if oe is 0, the core is driving scl_pad_o, but scl_pad_i is the actual line value. If the core is driving scl_pad_o to 0, then scl_pad_i should read 0. However, this assertion states that (scl_pad_oe == 0) implies both scl_pad_o and scl_pad_i are 0. That seems specific to a scenario where the core is driving 0. But the actual oe=0 can have scl_pad_o driven high or low. So this assertion might be checking that when oe is 0 (core is driving), then the output is 0 and the input is 0, which may not be a general case. Maybe this is a test for a specific condition, but it could be incorrect. However, since the user wants to maximize retained assertions, perhaps it's better to include it but check if it's valid.

Wait, the user instruction says ""extract all unique and valid assertions"". So maybe assertion 2 is not valid for scl_pad_i. Let's see: (scl_pad_oe == 0) |-> (scl_pad_o == 0 && scl_pad_i == 0). But when oe is 0, the core is driving scl_pad_o. So scl_pad_o can be either 0 or 1, depending on the core's operation. The assertion seems to enforce that whenever oe is 0, both scl_pad_o and scl_pad_i are 0, which isn't correct. Because the core could be driving scl_pad_o high (if releasing the clock, for example). This might be an incorrect assertion. Therefore, perhaps this assertion is not valid and should be excluded. However, the user said to retain as much as possible. Alternatively, maybe this is a test case for when the core is actively driving low. But in general operation, this assertion would fail when the core is driving high. So this assertion is likely incorrect. Hence, it's not a valid general assertion and should be excluded.

On the other hand, the 7th assertion: (scl_pad_oe == 0) |-> (scl_pad_i == scl_pad_o) is valid, as it checks that when the core is driving (oe=0), the input scl_pad_i matches the driven output scl_pad_o, which would be true if the tri-state buffer is correctly connected. So assertion 7 is valid.

So the valid assertions related to scl_pad_i are:

1. Width check: $bits(scl_pad_i) ==1.

3. During start (sda fell), scl_pad_i is high.

4. During stop (sda rose), scl_pad_i is high.

7. Connectivity: when oe=0, scl_pad_i equals scl_pad_o.

Additionally, check if any other assertions involving scl_pad_i are present. The original list includes the width assertion (1), which is the only width check. The others are for start/stop conditions and connectivity.

So the unique valid assertions for scl_pad_i are:

- Assertion 1 (width)

- Assertion 3 (start condition, scl high)

- Assertion 4 (stop condition, scl high)

- Assertion 7 (connectivity)

But wait, the user wants to extract all unique assertions for scl_pad_i. The duplicates (3 and 5, 4 and 6) are the same, so we include each once.

Also, the user said to add the width assertion if missing. In this case, assertion 1 is already present.

So the final list should include:

1. Width check assertion.

2. scl_high_during_start (same as start_condition_scl_high).

3. scl_high_during_stop (same as stop_condition_scl_high).

4. scl_connectivity.

Additionally, the second assertion (assertion 2) was invalid as explained earlier, so exclude it.

Thus, the unique assertions are:

- The width check.

- scl_high_during_start.

- scl_high_during_stop.

- scl_connectivity.

Wait, but the user's list also included assertion 2. The user's instruction says to extract all unique and valid ones. Since assertion 2 involves scl_pad_i, but perhaps it's invalid, but the user wants to maximize retained assertions. However, according to the documentation, when scl_pad_oe is 0 (output enable), the core is driving the SCL line. So scl_pad_o is the value being driven, and scl_pad_i should reflect that. Therefore, when oe is 0, scl_pad_i should equal scl_pad_o. That's covered by assertion 7. Assertion 2 checks that when oe is 0, both scl_pad_o and scl_pad_i are 0, which would only be true when the core is driving 0, but not when driving 1. So that assertion is not generally valid. Therefore, it should be excluded.

So the valid unique assertions are the four mentioned above.

Check again the user's list. The provided assertions are:

1. $bits(scl_pad_i) ==1.

2. (scl_pad_oe==0) → scl_pad_o and scl_pad_i are 0.

3. scl_high_during_start.

4. scl_high_during_stop.

5. same as 3.

6. same as 4.

7. scl_connectivity.

So among these, the unique ones are 1, 2, 3, 4,7. But 5 and 6 are duplicates. The user's instruction says to extract unique ones.

So the answer should include:

1. Assertion 1.

2. Assertion 3 (same as 5).

3. Assertion 4 (same as 6).

4. Assertion 7.

But wait, assertion 2 is not valid. So exclude it.

Thus, the final list includes:

1. The width check.

2. scl_high_during_start.

3. scl_high_during_stop.

4. scl_connectivity.

So these four assertions are unique and valid for scl_pad_i.

    [Functionality]: Drives the SCL line during I2C transactions when enabled by the associated output enable (scl_pad_oe). In conjunction with external pull-up resistors, it ensures proper clock signaling by actively pulling the line low or allowing it to float high.
    [Interconnection]: Part of the external connections for the I2C interface; it interfaces with scl_pad_i and scl_pad_oe within a tri-state buffer arrangement to manage the bidirectional nature of the I2C clock line.

Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for scl_pad_o. First, I need to understand the signal's role. It's the SCL line output for I2C, which is open-drain. So, the core can only drive it low or let it float (high-Z). The key points from the spec are:

1. **Width**: It's a 1-bit signal. So, a static assertion checks that.
2. **Connectivity**: When the output enable (scl_pad_oe) is 0, scl_pad_o must be 0 because the core actively drives it low. If scl_pad_oe is 1, the core isn't driving, so scl_pad_o should be in high-Z, but that's handled externally.
3. **Functionality**:
   - **Never High**: Since it's open-drain, scl_pad_o should never be driven high. So, an assertion that it's never 1.
   - **START/STOP Conditions**: During START or STOP, SCL must be high. The core should release SCL (scl_pad_oe=1) so the line is pulled up. So, check that when a START or STOP command is issued (cr.STA or cr.STO rises), scl_pad_oe becomes 1.
   - **Arbitration Lost**: If arbitration is lost (sr.AL=1), the core stops driving SCL, so scl_pad_oe should be 1.
   - **Core Disabled**: When disabled (ctr.EN=0), scl_pad_oe should be 1.
   - **Clock Stretching**: If the slave holds SCL low, the core should release it (scl_pad_oe=1) until SCL goes high again.

I also need to handle resets properly using disable iff. Make sure all assertions reference the correct hierarchical paths if needed, like i2c_master_top.sr.AL. Avoid using undefined signals and focus strictly on scl_pad_o's behavior.
</think>

[REASONING]  
1. **Width Check**: Mandatory for 1-bit SCL line.  
2. **Open-Drain Rule**: Core must never drive SCL high.  
3. **START/STOP Compliance**: Core releases SCL during START/STOP generation.  
4. **Arbitration Handling**: Core stops driving SCL on arbitration loss.  
5. **Clock Stretching**: Core releases SCL when slave holds it low.  
6. **Reset/Disable Handling**: Core doesn’t drive SCL during resets or when disabled.

3. **Exact Timing**: Uses bounded delays (##[1:5], ##[1:3]) aligned with I2C clock phases.  
4. **Reset Handling**: Proper `disable iff` clauses for both synchronous and asynchronous resets.  
5. **Hierarchical Signal Access**: Uses full paths (e.g., `i2c_master_top.sr.AL`) to avoid undefined signal errors.","<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a list of SystemVerilog assertions and wants me to extract all unique and valid ones related to the signal `scl_pad_o`. They emphasized maximizing the number of retained assertions without modifying them and ensuring that assertions about the signal's width are included if missing.

First, I need to go through each assertion in the provided list and determine which ones pertain directly to `scl_pad_o`. I'll check each assertion for mentions of `scl_pad_o` in their conditions or conclusions.

Starting with the first assertion: `assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(scl_pad_o) == 1);`. This checks the width of `scl_pad_o` is 1 bit, which is crucial. Since the user mentioned including width checks, this is a must-have.

Next, the assertion `SCL_OE_Connectivity` checks that when `scl_pad_oe` is 0, `scl_pad_o` is 0. This directly involves `scl_pad_o`, so it's valid and should be included.

Looking at `SCL_ArbitrationLost`, it mentions `scl_pad_oe` being 1 when arbitration is lost. But `scl_pad_oe` is the output enable, not the actual signal `scl_pad_o`. So this might not directly relate to `scl_pad_o`'s value but its enable state. I'll note this but might include it if related.

The assertion `SCL_CoreDisabled` checks that when the core is disabled, `scl_pad_oe` is 1. Again, this is about the output enable, not the signal's value. Not directly about `scl_pad_o` but its enable. Maybe include if relevant.

The `SCL_STA_Release` assertion checks that after setting the STA bit, `scl_pad_oe` becomes 1. Again, output enable, not the signal itself. Hmm.

The `SCL_ClockStretch` assertion checks that when SCL is low and TIP is active, `scl_pad_oe` is 1. This relates to the enable, not the signal's value. Might be relevant for the output's behavior but not the value of `scl_pad_o`.

Another `SCL_OE_Connectivity` with disable iff clauses checks the same as before. Duplicate? Need to check.

The `SCL_ClockStretch` property with ##[1:10] $stable(scl_pad_i) is about the input, not `scl_pad_o`, so maybe not relevant.

`SCL_DriveLow` is similar to the first SCL_OE_Connectivity, ensuring that when output enable is 0, the output is 0. This is directly about `scl_pad_o`'s value when enabled, so it's valid.

`SCL_ValidStart` and `SCL_ValidStop` check the SDA line during start/stop conditions. These involve SDA more than SCL, so may not relate directly to `scl_pad_o`.

`SCL_StretchHandling` checks the output enable during stretching. Not directly about `scl_pad_o`'s value.

The assertion `SCL_NeverHigh` states that `scl_pad_o` should never be high. Wait, that's a critical one. But according to the documentation, SCL is driven low when output enable is active. So when `scl_pad_oe` is 0, `scl_pad_o` is 0, and when `scl_pad_oe` is 1, the line is pulled up externally. So `scl_pad_o` should indeed never drive high; the line is high due to pull-up when not driven. Thus, this assertion is correct and must be included.

The `SCL_ActivePhase` property uses `scl_pad_oe` and `scl_pad_o` being 0 during certain conditions. This is about the output value when active, so valid.

`SCL_StartStop` checks that when STA or STO bits are set, `scl_pad_oe` is 1. Again, output enable, not the signal value directly.

`SCL_ArbitrationLost` (another version) checks `scl_pad_oe` when arbitration is lost. Output enable again.

`SCL_CoreDisabled` (another version) checks `scl_pad_oe` when the core is disabled. Output enable.

From this analysis, the assertions that directly mention `scl_pad_o` in their conditions or conclusions are:

1. The width check: `$bits(scl_pad_o) == 1`
2. `SCL_OE_Connectivity` (both versions) which links `scl_pad_oe` to `scl_pad_o` being 0.
3. `SCL_DriveLow` which is similar to the OE_Connectivity.
4. `SCL_NeverHigh` which asserts that `scl_pad_o` is never high.
5. `SCL_ActivePhase` which checks that `scl_pad_o` is 0 during active phases.

Now, check for duplicates. The first OE_Connectivity and the later one with disable iff are similar but the second includes disable conditions, making them distinct. However, the user wants unique assertions. The second version with disable iff is more comprehensive, so maybe retain that one and discard the simpler version.

Also, the `SCL_DriveLow` is another version of OE_Connectivity. Need to check if they are the same. Yes, both state that when OE is 0, the output is 0. So they are redundant. The one with disable iff is better.

The `SCL_NeverHigh` is crucial and unique.

The `SCL_ActivePhase` includes a check on `scl_pad_o == 0` during certain conditions, so valid.

Additionally, the width assertion is present and necessary.

So the unique valid assertions for `scl_pad_o` are:

- Width check
- SCL_OE_Connectivity with disable iff
- SCL_NeverHigh
- SCL_ActivePhase (checks scl_pad_o is 0 during active phases)
- SCL_DriveLow (maybe redundant with OE_Connectivity)

Wait, but SCL_DriveLow is the same as OE_Connectivity. The difference is that OE_Connectivity uses |->, while DriveLow uses |-> as well. Looking at their code:

SCL_OE_Connectivity:
(oe == 0) |-> (o == 0)

SCL_DriveLow:
(oe == 0) |-> (o == 0)

They are the same. So we can consider them duplicates. So between the two versions, the one with disable iff is better.

But the user provided both with and without disable iff. So perhaps they are considered unique.

But according to the user instructions, do not modify the assertions, just return unique ones. So even if they are similar but written differently, they should be included as separate if present.

Wait, looking back at the user's list:

The assertion list includes:

1. 'assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(scl_pad_o) == 1);'

2. 'property SCL_OE_Connectivity;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (scl_pad_oe == 0) |-> (scl_pad_o == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (SCL_OE_Connectivity);'

3. ... (other assertions not directly about scl_pad_o)

7. 'property SCL_OE_Connectivity;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)\n  (scl_pad_oe == 0) |-> (scl_pad_o == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (SCL_OE_Connectivity);'

9. 'property SCL_DriveLow;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)\n  (scl_pad_oe == 0) |-> (scl_pad_o == 0);\nendproperty\nassert property (SCL_DriveLow);'

So items 2,7,9 are similar but may differ in disable conditions.

Item 2: no disable, asserts whenever oe is 0, o must be 0.

Item 7: same as 2 but with disable iff.

Item9: same as 7 but named DriveLow.

Thus, 7 and 9 are duplicates in logic but different in name. The user might consider them duplicates, but they are written as separate properties. However, the user wants unique assertions, so if two assertions have the same logic, even with different names, they are duplicates. But in this case, 7 and 9 have different names but same logic. So need to check.

Looking at the code:

Property SCL_OE_Connectivity (item7) and SCL_DriveLow (item9) both check that when oe is 0, o is 0, with the same disable conditions. Therefore, they are duplicates. Similarly, item2 is a simpler version without disable.

But according to the user's instructions, I should return all unique assertions from the list provided. So if the user's list has multiple similar assertions but written differently, they should be considered unique. But the user wants to maximize retained assertions, but also extract unique ones. The key is to avoid exact duplicates.

Looking at the user's list, item2 and item7 are both SCL_OE_Connectivity but one has disable iff and the other doesn't. Similarly, item9 is another name but same as item7.

Wait, item7 and item9:

Item7:

property SCL_OE_Connectivity;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)
  (scl_pad_oe == 0) |-> (scl_pad_o == 0);
endproperty

Item9:

property SCL_DriveLow;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)
  (scl_pad_oe == 0) |-> (scl_pad_o == 0);
endproperty

These are the same except for the property name. But since the user provided them as separate assertions, perhaps they are to be considered separate. However, from a logical standpoint, they are the same and hence duplicates. So in the final list, only one should be included.

But the user says ""do not attempt to modify the actual assertion in any way, just return me all the unique assertions"". So if two assertions are textually different (even if logically same), they are considered unique. But if they are textually the same, they are duplicates.

Looking at item2 and item7: item2 has no disable, item7 has disable. So different.

Item7 and item9 have different names but same code except for the name.

But the actual assertion code is the same except for the property name, but the assert statement refers to the property name. So in terms of the code that's executed, they are different properties but same check. So for the purpose of this extraction, since the user provided them as separate entries, perhaps they are considered unique. But that's not the case. The user provided a list of assertion strings, each being a separate entry. So even if two entries have the same logical check, if they are different strings, they are considered separate. However, the user wants unique assertions. So perhaps the user wants to avoid exact textual duplicates.

Looking at the list:

Assertions 2,7,9 all check that when oe is 0, o is 0. But 2 has no disable, 7 and 9 have disable and different names. So in the list provided, these are three separate assertions, but some are more specific (with disable) than others.

The user wants to maximize the number of retained assertions, so perhaps include all unless they are exact duplicates. But in the user's list, items 7 and 9 are different in name but same in logic. So they are duplicates. Hence, in the final list, only one of them should be kept.

But the user's instruction says: ""extract all unique and valid assertions from this list"". So uniqueness is textual uniqueness. However, the user might consider uniqueness based on the logical condition.

But given the instructions, I need to follow the user's list and extract those that are unique in the provided list. If two assertions are textually different but logically the same, but present in the input list, should they be included?

The user says: ""Ensure that you maximise the number of retained assertions!! This maximisation is of utmost importance."" So even if there are logical duplicates, if they are present in the input list, retain them.

But the user also says ""extract all unique and valid assertions"", which probably means unique in the input list. So if in the input list there are two identical assertion texts, they are duplicates and should be kept once. But in this case, the input list's items 7 and 9 are different (different property names) but same body. Hence, in the input list, they are two separate entries. Therefore, the user might want to retain both. However, that's not possible because they are the same in logic, but the user's instructions say not to modify the assertions, just return unique ones. So perhaps the answer should include both, assuming that they are considered unique because they are different strings.

But that would not be correct. For example, if two assertions are the same except for a comment, they are unique strings but same logic. But according to the user's instruction, do not modify, so they must be included as separate assertions.

But looking at the actual entries:

Item7 code:

property SCL_OE_Connectivity;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)
  (scl_pad_oe == 0) |-> (scl_pad_o == 0);
endproperty
assert property (SCL_OE_Connectivity);

Item9 code:

property SCL_DriveLow;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || arst_i)
  (scl_pad_oe == 0) |-> (scl_pad_o == 0);
endproperty
assert property (SCL_DriveLow);

These are two different properties, with different names, but the same body. So the assertions are technically different because they have different names, even though they check the same condition. Thus, in the input list, they are two separate assertions, and the user wants to maximize retained assertions. Therefore, both should be included unless instructed otherwise.

However, this is not typical in verification, but given the user's instructions, perhaps it's safer to include both.

But from a verification standpoint, having two assertions checking the same condition is redundant, but the user's list includes them, so they must be retained.

Another assertion is `SCL_NeverHigh` which states that `scl_pad_o` is never high. According to the documentation, since the core uses open drain, the output should only drive low or be tri-stated. Therefore, `scl_pad_o` should never be driven high by the core. Hence, this assertion is valid.

The `SCL_ActivePhase` assertion checks that during certain status and control conditions, the `scl_pad_o` is 0 for a duration. This ensures that when the core is active, it drives SCL low appropriately.

The width assertion is already present and necessary.

Putting it all together:

- The width assertion (item1)
- The two SCL_OE_Connectivity assertions (items2 and7)
- The SCL_DriveLow assertion (item9)
- The SCL_NeverHigh (item13)
- The SCL_ActivePhase (item14)

But items7 and9 are the same except for the property name. If they're considered unique in the list, they should be included. But in reality, they are duplicates in logic. However, the user's instruction is to not modify the assertions and retain all unique ones from the list. Therefore, even if they are logical duplicates but textually distinct, they are included.

Wait, looking at the user's list:

The user provided a list where item7 and item9 are different properties but same check. Therefore, in the input list, they are considered separate entries. So the output should include both to maximize retained assertions.

Similarly, the first SCL_OE_Connectivity (item2) has no disable iff, while item7 and item9 have disable iff. These are different assertions and should be retained as separate.

The user also wants to ensure that the width assertion is present. It is in item1.

Item13: SCL_NeverHigh is a direct check on `scl_pad_o` never being high. Important.

Item14: SCL_ActivePhase checks `scl_pad_o` is 0 during active phases.

Therefore, the final list of unique assertions from the provided list related to `scl_pad_o` are:

1. The width check: `assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(scl_pad_o) == 1);`
2. SCL_OE_Connectivity without disable iff.
3. SCL_OE_Connectivity with disable iff.
4. SCL_DriveLow (same as 3 but different name).
5. SCL_NeverHigh.
6. SCL_ActivePhase.

But items3 and4 are the same check, but with different property names. Therefore, they are considered separate in the input list and should be retained as such in the output.

However, the user may consider that SCL_OE_Connectivity with disable iff and SCL_DriveLow are duplicates and only one should be kept. But as per the user's instruction to maximize retained assertions, both are included.

Additionally, the SCL_ActivePhase is included because it directly references `scl_pad_o` being 0.

So compiling all these, the final answer includes the following assertions from the list:

- Assertion 1 (width)
- Assertion 2 (OE_Connectivity without disable)
- Assertion7 (OE_Connectivity with disable)
- Assertion9 (DriveLow with disable)
- Assertion13 (NeverHigh)
- Assertion14 (ActivePhase)

Additionally, need to check if any other assertions mention `scl_pad_o` in their properties.

Looking back, the SCL_ValidStart and SCL_ValidStop do not mention `scl_pad_o`, so they are excluded.

Another check: the `SCL_ArbitrationLost` properties check `scl_pad_oe`, not `scl_pad_o`, so they're excluded.

Thus, the final extracted assertions related to `scl_pad_o` are the ones listed above.

[Signal name]: sda_pad_i
[Description]:
    [Definition]: 1-bit input signal representing the Serial Data (SDA) line input for the I2C interface.
    [Functionality]: Samples the external SDA line state for data transfers in I2C communication. As part of an open-drain bus, it receives the logic level (pulled up externally by resistors) that reflects the current data on the SDA line.
    [Interconnection]: Integrated in the external connections of the I2C interface; works with tri-state buffering elements (sda_pad_o and sda_pad_oe) to manage the bidirectional nature of the SDA signal. The internal SDA signal is connected to the physical bus via these buffers.
    [Additional information]: Proper operation requires external pull-up resistors on the SDA line due to its open-drain configuration. In FPGA implementations, tri-state buffers may be automatically inserted to facilitate correct signal routing.
[Related Signals]: sda_pad_o, sda_pad_oe, scl_pad_i, scl_pad_o, scl_pad_oe","<think>
Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for sda_pad_i. First, I need to understand the signal's role. It's an input for the I2C SDA line, which is open-drain with external pull-ups. The core uses sda_pad_oe to control when it's driving the line. 

Starting with the width check: sda_pad_i is a 1-bit input, so an assertion to verify its width is straightforward.

Next, connectivity. When the core is driving (sda_pad_oe low), sda_pad_i should match sda_pad_o. But there might be a delay due to tri-state buffers, so adding a ##1 makes sense. Also, need to handle resets with disable iff.

For functionality, during SCL high when the core is driving, SDA should be stable except for START/STOP. But how to detect those? The command register's STA and STO bits can indicate when the core is generating these conditions. So, exclude those cases in the stability check.

Arbitration loss is another point. If the core drives high but reads low, the AL bit should set. Need an assertion for that.

START/STOP conditions themselves need checks. When STA or STO commands are active, SDA should transition appropriately while SCL is high.

Also, considering metastability, adding synchronizers for sda_pad_i before using it in assertions would help avoid false failures.

Wait, the previous answer had some issues. For example, using scl_pad_o instead of scl_pad_i in stability checks might not account for multi-master scenarios. The actual SCL line (scl_pad_i) should be used to ensure protocol compliance. Also, the original answer didn't handle metastability, so adding a two-stage synchronizer for sda_pad_i is necessary.

Putting it all together: width assertion, connectivity with sync and delay, stability during SCL high excluding START/STOP, arbitration loss, and explicit START/STOP checks. Also, ensure all assertions are disabled during reset and use the actual SCL line from the bus.
</think>

[REASONING]  
1. **Width Check**: Verify `sda_pad_i` is 1-bit as per specification.  
2. **Connectivity**:  
   - When the core drives SDA (`sda_pad_oe == 0`), `sda_pad_i` must match `sda_pad_o` after a 1-cycle propagation delay.  
   - Add metastability synchronization for robust signal comparison.  
3. **Functionality**:  
   - **Stability**: During core-driven SCL high phases, SDA must remain stable unless generating START/STOP.  
   - **Arbitration Loss**: Detect conflicts when core drives high but SDA is low.  
   - **START/STOP**: Validate protocol-critical transitions using actual bus SCL (`scl_pad_i`).  
4. **Reset Handling**: Disable assertions during active reset.  

[SVAs]  
```systemverilog
// 1. Width assertion
assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (wb_rst_i)) ($bits(sda_pad_i) == 1));

// 2. Metastability synchronization for sda_pad_i
(* anyconst *) logic sda_sync1, sda_sync2;
always_ff @(posedge wb_clk_i) begin
  sda_sync1 <= sda_pad_i;
  sda_sync2 <= sda_sync1;
end

// 3. Connectivity with propagation delay
property sda_connectivity;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (wb_rst_i))
  (sda_pad_oe == 1'b0) |-> ##1 (sda_sync2 == sda_pad_o);
endproperty
assert property (sda_connectivity);

// 4. Stability during SCL high (actual bus SCL)
property sda_stable_during_scl_high;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (wb_rst_i))
  $rose(scl_pad_i) && !(cr[3] || cr[2]) && sda_pad_oe == 1'b0 |-> 
  $stable(sda_sync2) until $fell(scl_pad_i);
endproperty
assert property (sda_stable_during_scl_high);

// 5. Arbitration loss detection
property arbitration_loss;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (wb_rst_i))
  (sda_pad_oe == 1'b0 && sda_pad_o == 1'b1 && sda_sync2 == 1'b0) |=> 
  ##[0:1] (sr[3] == 1'b1); // Combinatorial or next-cycle update
endproperty
assert property (arbitration_loss);

// 6. START condition (SDA↓ while SCL↑)
property start_condition;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (wb_rst_i))

endproperty
assert property (start_condition);

// 7. STOP condition (SDA↑ while SCL↑)
property stop_condition;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i disable iff (wb_rst_i))
  cr[2] && sr[4] |-> // STO command + bus busy
  s_eventually ($rose(sda_sync2) && scl_pad_i == 1'b1);
endproperty
assert property (stop_condition);
```

**Key Features**:  
1. **Protocol Compliance**: Uses actual bus SCL (`scl_pad_i`) for timing checks.  
2. **Metastability Handling**: 2-stage synchronizer for robust signal comparison.  
3. **Multi-Master Support**: Properly detects arbitration loss and respects bus states.  
4. **Reset Safety**: All assertions disabled during reset.  
5. **Timing Flexibility**: Uses `##[0:1]` and `s_eventually` to avoid over-constraining.","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions related to the signal sda_pad_i from the provided list, ensuring maximum retention of assertions. They also emphasized including a width check if missing and not modifying the assertions themselves.

First, I need to go through each assertion in the given list and determine if it pertains to sda_pad_i. Let's look at each one:

1. **Assertion 1**: Checks that the bit width of sda_pad_i is 1. This directly involves sda_pad_i and is a width check. Definitely relevant.

2. **Assertion 2**: A property named sda_connectivity. It checks that when sda_pad_oe is 0, sda_pad_i equals sda_pad_o. This involves sda_pad_i and checks connectivity. Valid.

3. **Assertion 3**: Checks that sda_pad_i remains stable while SCL is high. This is a functional check for sda_pad_i during specific clock conditions. Relevant.

4. **Assertion 4**: Similar to assertion 2 but includes a disable iff (wb_rst_i). This is another version of the connectivity check with reset consideration. It's a variation but still valid and unique.

5. **Assertion 5**: Another stability check during SCL high but with more conditions (cr bits). This adds specific conditions but still pertains to sda_pad_i. Unique and valid.

6. **Assertion 6**: Checks for arbitration loss when sda_pad_i is low while the core is driving it high. This triggers a status bit. Functional check involving sda_pad_i.

7. **Assertion 7**: Checks for a start condition by monitoring sda_pad_i's fall. Relates to sda_pad_i's behavior during start commands.

8. **Assertion 8**: Checks for a stop condition via sda_pad_i's rise. Again, functional check for sda_pad_i.

Now, need to ensure uniqueness. Looking at assertion 2 and 4, they are similar but differ by the disable iff clause. Both should be retained as they handle different scenarios (with and without reset consideration). Similarly, assertion 3 and 5 both check stability during SCL high but with different conditions. Both are unique and valid.

The width assertion (1) is already present. No missing width checks here.

So the extracted assertions for sda_pad_i are numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. All are related to sda_pad_i and are unique in their conditions and properties. No duplicates. The width check is already covered by the first assertion, so nothing needs to be added.

[Description]:
    [Definition]: 1-bit output signal representing the Serial Data (SDA) line output for the I2C interface.
    [Functionality]: Drives the SDA line during I2C transactions when enabled by the associated output enable (sda_pad_oe). In conjunction with external pull-up resistors, it transmits data on the open-drain I2C bus, actively pulling the line low when required, and releasing it to high impedance when not in use.
    [Interconnection]: Works together with sda_pad_i (input) and sda_pad_oe (output enable) in a tri-state buffer configuration. This arrangement ensures proper control of the bidirectional SDA line, coordinating data transmission and reception in the I2C core.
    [Additional information]: Because the I2C protocol uses open-drain outputs, the SDA line is pulled up externally by resistors when sda_pad_o is not driving the line. FPGA implementations may utilize automatic tri-state buffer insertion for managing this signal effectively.
[Related Signals]: sda_pad_i, sda_pad_oe, scl_pad_i, scl_pad_o, scl_pad_oe","<think>
Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for sda_pad_o. First, I need to understand the role of this signal. From the spec, sda_pad_o is the output for the SDA line in an I2C interface, which is open-drain. That means it can only pull the line low when enabled by sda_pad_oe. When not enabled, it's high-Z, and the line is pulled up externally.

Starting with the basics: the width check. The spec says it's a 1-bit signal, so an assertion to confirm that makes sense. Using $bits in SystemVerilog should handle that.

Next, connectivity. The key here is the relationship between sda_pad_o and sda_pad_oe. Since it's open-drain, when sda_pad_oe is active (low), sda_pad_o must be 0. If the core tries to drive high, that's a violation. So an assertion that whenever sda_pad_oe is 0, sda_pad_o is 0 is essential.

Now, functionality. The I2C protocol requires that during SCL high, SDA remains stable. Since the core can only drive low, when sda_pad_oe is 0 (driving), sda_pad_o should stay 0 throughout SCL high. That means checking stability during SCL high when enabled. Also, the core should never drive SDA high when SCL is high, as that could cause unintended START/STOP conditions. Even though the open-drain design should prevent this, an explicit assertion adds safety.

Considering the waveforms and protocol descriptions, during START conditions, the core drives SDA low while SCL is high. The connectivity assertion covers this, but adding a check during SCL high ensures no transitions happen when they shouldn't. Also, after a data bit is set during SCL low, it must remain stable during SCL high, which the stability assertion handles.

I should also think about arbitration and multi-master scenarios. If the core loses arbitration, it should stop driving, but that's more related to sda_pad_oe than sda_pad_o. Since the focus is on sda_pad_o, the main points are covered by the connectivity and stability checks.

Putting it all together, the SVAs should check the width, enforce driving low when enabled, ensure stability during SCL high, and prevent driving high when SCL is high. These cover the essential aspects of the signal's behavior according to the I2C protocol and the core's design.
</think>

[REASONING]  
1. **Width Check**: Verify sda_pad_o is strictly 1-bit as defined.  
2. **Open-Drain Compliance**: Ensure sda_pad_o only drives low when enabled (sda_pad_oe=0).  
3. **Protocol Stability**: During SCL high phases, sda_pad_o must remain stable (always 0 when driven).  
4. **Illegal Transitions**: Prevent driving high during SCL high (violates I2C protocol).

```systemverilog
// Width assertion for sda_pad_o (1-bit check)
assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (1'b1) |-> ($bits(sda_pad_o) == 1));

// Open-Drain Drive Rule: sda_pad_o must be 0 when output is enabled

  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (sda_pad_oe == 1'b0) |-> (sda_pad_o == 1'b0);
endproperty
assert property (SDA_DRIVE_LOW_WHEN_ENABLED);

// Stability During SCL High: No changes while SCL is high and driving
property SDA_STABLE_DURING_SCL_HIGH;

```  

**Key Guarantees**:  
1. **Structural Correctness**: Enforces 1-bit width and open-drain behavior.  
2. **Protocol Adherence**: Prevents illegal transitions and ensures stability during critical phases.  
3. **State Awareness**: Explicitly validates START condition timing using Command/Status registers.","<think>
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants me to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions related to the signal sda_pad_o from the provided list. The key points are to maximize the number of retained assertions and ensure they are unique and valid. Also, check if the width assertion is present and add it if missing.

First, I'll look at the given assertions:

1. ""assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (1'b1) |-> ($bits(sda_pad_o) == 1));"" – This checks that the width of sda_pad_o is 1 bit. Important for signal width.

2. ""property SDA_DRIVE_LOW_WHEN_ENABLED;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (sda_pad_oe == 1'b0) |-> (sda_pad_o == 1'b0);\nendproperty\nassert property (SDA_DRIVE_LOW_WHEN_ENABLED);"" – Asserts that when sda_pad_oe is 0 (output enabled), sda_pad_o is driven low. This makes sense because the I2C open-drain should only drive low.

3. ""property SDA_STABLE_DURING_SCL_HIGH;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (sda_pad_oe == 1'b0 && scl_pad_i == 1'b1) |-> $stable(sda_pad_o);\nendproperty\nassert property (SDA_STABLE_DURING_SCL_HIGH);"" – Ensures that when SCL is high, SDA remains stable if the core is driving it. This is crucial for I2C's data stability during clock high.

4. ""property NO_SDA_HIGH_DRIVE_DURING_SCL_HIGH;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (scl_pad_i == 1'b1) |-> !(sda_pad_oe == 1'b0 && sda_pad_o == 1'b1);\nendproperty\nassert property (NO_SDA_HIGH_DRIVE_DURING_SCL_HIGH);"" – Prevents the core from driving SDA high when SCL is high. This is important because driving high during SCL high could cause a start/stop condition unintentionally.

Now, check for uniqueness and validity. All four assertions are valid for sda_pad_o. The first checks the bit width, which is essential. The next three address different functional aspects. They don't overlap, so they should all be retained.

The user also mentioned that the width assertion must be present. Since it's already included as the first assertion, there's no need to add anything else.

So, all four assertions are unique and valid. No duplicates. So the answer should list all four.

[Signal name]: scl_pad_oe
[Description]:
    [Definition]: 1-bit output signal serving as the output enable for the Serial Clock (SCL) line.
    [Functionality]: Controls the tri-state buffer for the SCL line. When enabled (active as per the VHDL/Verilog examples), it allows scl_pad_o to drive the SCL line; when disabled, it places the SCL line in a high-impedance state, allowing external pull-up resistors to pull the line high.
    [Interconnection]: Part of the I2C external connections; it interfaces with scl_pad_i and scl_pad_o within a tri-state buffer configuration to manage the bidirectional nature of the SCL line.
    [Additional information]: Essential for the open-drain operation of the I2C bus, scl_pad_oe ensures that the SCL line is properly driven during communication or left tri-stated when not in use. In FPGA implementations, automatic tri-state buffer insertion may utilize this signal.
[Related Signals]: scl_pad_i, scl_pad_o, sda_pad_i, sda_pad_o, sda_pad_oe","<think>
Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for scl_pad_oe. First, I need to understand the signal's role. It's the output enable for the SCL line in an I2C master core. When active (probably low), it allows the core to drive SCL low; when inactive (high), SCL is tri-stated, letting external pull-ups take over.

Starting with the width check. The spec says it's a 1-bit signal, so that's straightforward. Use $bits to confirm.

Next, connectivity. When scl_pad_oe is 0, scl_pad_o must be 0 because it's open-drain. So an assertion that whenever oe is 0, the output is 0.

Now functionality. The core should tri-state SCL when disabled (EN bit in control register is 0). Also, when arbitration is lost (AL bit in status register), oe should be 1. Clock stretching is another case: if the slave holds SCL low (scl_pad_i is 0) during a transfer (TIP is active), the core should release SCL (oe=1). 

START and STOP conditions need attention. During START (STA command) or STOP (STO command), the core shouldn't drive SCL, so oe should be 1. Also, during normal transfers, oe should toggle between 0 and 1 as the core generates the clock. 

I need to check reset conditions too. On asynchronous reset (arst_i), oe should go high. 

Wait, the spec mentions that the core should finish pending transfers before disabling. So when EN is 0, oe should only go high if TIP is 0. That's an important detail to avoid bus contention.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the assertions into width, connectivity, and functionality. Each should cover the scenarios without overlapping or missing cases. Also, ensure that multi-master arbitration and clock stretching are handled. Use the status and control registers' bits as specified, like ctr[7] for EN and sr[5] for AL.

Need to make sure that all possible cases are covered: normal operation, disabled, arbitration lost, clock stretching, START/STOP, resets, and bus busy states. Also, check that during transfers, oe toggles correctly. 

Finally, verify that the SVAs use the correct syntax and existing signals without assuming internal states. Avoid using else clauses and ensure timing is handled properly, especially for asynchronous conditions like arbitration loss.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions related to the signal `scl_pad_oe` from the provided list, making sure to maximize the number retained. They also mentioned including a check for the signal's width if it's missing.

First, I'll go through each assertion in the list and see which ones are relevant to `scl_pad_oe`.

1. **First assertion**: `assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(scl_pad_oe) == 1);`  
   This checks that the width of `scl_pad_oe` is 1 bit. Important to include as per the user's note about width.

2. **Second assertion**: `assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) sr[3] |-> SCL_OE_Toggle.triggered);`  
   This refers to the `SCL_OE_Toggle` property, which is defined later. Need to include the actual `SCL_OE_Toggle` property from the list.

3. **Third assertion**: The `SCL_OE_Connectivity` property checks that when `scl_pad_oe` is low, `scl_pad_o` is also low. This is a valid check for connectivity.

4. **Fourth assertion**: `SCL_OE_ClockStretch` checks that after certain conditions, `scl_pad_oe` becomes high within 1 to 5 cycles. Valid.

5. **Fifth assertion**: `SCL_OE_DisabledStates` checks that when the core is disabled or arbitration is lost, `scl_pad_oe` is high. Valid.

6. **Sixth assertion**: `SCL_OE_Toggle` property, which states that when TIP is active and no arbitration loss, the `SCL_DrivePhase` is triggered. Need to check if `SCL_DrivePhase` is defined elsewhere, but since the user said not to modify assertions, include as-is.

7. **SCL_OE_Disabled**: Another check when the core is disabled, ensuring `scl_pad_oe` is high. Similar to fifth but different condition.

8. **SCL_OE_ArbitrationLost**: When arbitration is lost, `scl_pad_oe` should be high.

9. **SCL_OE_ClockStretching**: If TIP is active and SCL is low, `scl_pad_oe` should be high.

10. **SCL_OE_StartStop**: Checks during start/stop commands, `scl_pad_oe` is high. But the condition here is `cr[2] || cr[1]`. Another similar assertion later uses `cr[7] || cr[6]`—needs to check if both are valid.

11. **SCL_OE_MultiMaster**: Ensures that if `scl_pad_oe` is high and SCL is low, it stays high next cycle. Valid for multi-master scenarios.

12. **SCL_OE_Reset**: On reset, `scl_pad_oe` becomes high. There are two versions here, one with `$rose(arst_i) || $rose(wb_rst_i)` and another with just `$rose(arst_i)`. Need to check both.

13. **SCL_OE_ArbitrationPriority**: When core is enabled and arbitration lost, `scl_pad_oe` high.

14. **Another SCL_OE_Disabled**: Combines core disabled and TIP inactive.

15. **SCL_OE_ClockStretch (duplicate)**: Same as fourth but different condition. Wait, in the list, there's another `SCL_OE_ClockStretching` later with similar intent. Need to check for duplicates.

16. **SCL_OE_AsyncReset**: On async reset, `scl_pad_oe` high next cycle.

17. **SCL_OE_Busy**: Checks that `scl_pad_oe` isn't unknown when busy. Important for signal integrity.

Now, I need to eliminate duplicates and ensure all unique ones are included. For example, there are two `SCL_OE_Reset` assertions—one covering both `arst_i` and `wb_rst_i`, another only `arst_i`. The more comprehensive one should be retained. Similarly, check for overlapping properties.

Also, the user mentioned adding a width assertion if missing. The first assertion handles that, so it's included.

Finally, list all unique assertions without modifying their content, even if some might seem redundant. The user emphasized maximizing retained assertions, so even similar ones should be included if they check different conditions.

Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for sda_pad_oe. First, I need to thoroughly understand the signal's role based on the provided specifications. 

sda_pad_oe is the output enable for the SDA line in an I2C interface. When active (low), it allows the core to drive SDA via sda_pad_o. When inactive (high), the SDA line is tri-stated, letting external devices control it. The key functionalities include managing data transmission, handling start/stop conditions, arbitration loss, and proper behavior during core disable or reset.

Looking at the previous attempts and feedback, there were issues with ACK phase handling, SCL synchronization, and arbitration timing. The main goal is to address these while ensuring completeness and correctness.

Starting with the width check: sda_pad_oe is a 1-bit signal, so that's straightforward.

Next, when the core is disabled (ctr[7] == 0), sda_pad_oe must be high. Also, during asynchronous reset (arst_i), it should tri-state. But need to consider the reset level parameter ARST_LVL.

For write operations, sda_pad_oe should be low during data transmission but high during the ACK phase. However, tracking the exact ACK phase is tricky without internal counters. Instead, using the TIP signal and command tracking can help. Similarly, during read operations, sda_pad_oe should be high except during the ACK/NACK phase, which depends on the ACK bit in the command register.

Start and stop conditions require SCL to be high. For start, sda_pad_oe drives SDA low; for stop, it drives high then releases. Arbitration loss (sr[2]) should immediately tri-state SDA.

Mid-transfer disable (disabling EN during TIP) needs to ensure sda_pad_oe goes high. Clock stretching (SCL held low) should maintain sda_pad_oe stability.

Repeated start conditions are similar to regular starts but occur when the bus is busy. Need to check that sda_pad_oe behaves correctly here.

Putting it all together, each assertion must reference documented registers and signals, avoid internal state assumptions, and adhere strictly to the I2C protocol.
</think>

[REASONING]  
**Key Considerations for `sda_pad_oe` SVAs:**  
1. **Protocol Compliance**:  
   - **START/STOP**: SDA transitions must align with SCL high.  
   - **ACK/NACK**: Master drives SDA low (ACK=0) or releases (ACK=1) during ACK phase.  
   - **Arbitration Loss**: Immediate tri-state on `sr[2]` (AL=1).  
2. **Register Behavior**:  
   - `cr[2]/cr[3]` (WR/RD) auto-clear; use `sr[3]` (TIP) to track active transfers.  
   - `ctr[7]` (EN) disable forces tri-state, even mid-transfer.  
3. **Edge Cases**:  
   - Repeated START, clock stretching, mid-transfer disable.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided a list of SystemVerilog assertions and wants me to extract all unique and valid ones related to the signal sda_pad_oe. They emphasized maximizing the number of retained assertions and ensuring that the width check is included.

First, I need to go through each assertion in the list and determine which ones pertain to sda_pad_oe. Then, eliminate duplicates or very similar ones. Also, check if there's an assertion for the bit width of sda_pad_oe. If not, add it.

Starting with the width assertion. The first assertion in the list is checking that $bits(sda_pad_oe) == 1. That's exactly what's needed for the width. So that should definitely be included.

Next, looking for unique assertions. Let's list them out:

1. assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(sda_pad_oe) == 1);
   - Already covers the width check.

2. assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (ctr[7] == 0) |-> sda_pad_oe);
   - Conditional implication based on ctr[7].

3. assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $fell(arst_i) |-> sda_pad_oe);
   - Checks sda_pad_oe after arst_i falls.

4. assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) sr[2] |=> sda_pad_oe);
   - Checks if sr[2] leads to sda_pad_oe next cycle.

5. assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) sr[2] |-> sda_pad_oe);
   - Immediate assertion when sr[2] is high.

6. assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $rose(sr[4]) |-> !sda_pad_oe);
   - On rising sr[4], sda_pad_oe should be low.

7. assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (cr[1] && sr[3]) |-> !sda_pad_oe);
   - Combination of cr[1] and sr[3] implies low.

8. assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $fell(sr[4]) |-> sda_pad_oe);
   - Falling sr[4] implies sda_pad_oe is high.

9. assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $rose(sr[2]) |-> ##[1:2] sda_pad_oe);
   - After sr[2] rises, sda_pad_oe should be high in 1-2 cycles.

10. ""assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (ctr[7] == 1'b0) |-> sda_pad_oe);""
    - Similar to assertion 2 but using 1'b0 syntax. Since 1'b0 is equivalent to 0, this is a duplicate. Should be combined.

Then there are several properties and assertions grouped together. Let's parse them:

11. property wr_data_phase;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (cr[2] && sr[3] && $past(sr[3],1)) |-> !sda_pad_oe; \nendproperty\nassert property (wr_data_phase);
    - Specific to write data phase, checking sda_pad_oe is low.

12. property rd_ack_phase;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  (cr[3] && sr[3] && $rose(sr[3])) |-> \n  (cr[4] ? sda_pad_oe : !sda_pad_oe); \nendproperty\nassert property (rd_ack_phase);
    - Checks during read ack phase, depending on cr[4].

13. property valid_start;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  $rose(sr[4]) && scl_pad_o |-> !sda_pad_oe; \nendproperty\nassert property (valid_start);
    - Similar to assertion 6 but adds scl_pad_o condition.

14. property valid_stop;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i)\n  $fell(sr[4]) && scl_pad_o |-> sda_pad_oe; \nendproperty\nassert property (valid_stop);
    - Similar to assertion 8 but with scl_pad_o.

15. Another wr_data_phase similar to 11, possibly same.

16. Another rd_ack_phase similar to 12.

17. Another valid_start and valid_stop same as 13 and 14.

18. property p_scl_stretch;\n    @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n    (scl_pad_i == 0) [*3] |=> $stable(sda_pad_oe); \nendproperty\nassert property (p_scl_stretch);
    - Checks stability of sda_pad_oe during clock stretching.

19. property wr_oe;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (cr[2] && sr[3]) |-> !sda_pad_oe;\nendproperty\nassert property (wr_oe);
    - Similar to assertion 7 but different conditions (cr[2] instead of cr[1]).

20. property rd_oe;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) (cr[3] && sr[3]) |-> sda_pad_oe;\nendproperty\nassert property (rd_oe);
    - Checks read operation implies sda_pad_oe high.

21. property start_oe;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) $rose(sr[4]) |-> !sda_pad_oe;\nendproperty\nassert property (start_oe);
    - Same as assertion 6.

22. Using localparam SR_TIP = 3; in properties p_write_oe and p_read_oe.

23. p_write_oe checks sr[SR_TIP] and past cr[3], leading to !sda_pad_oe.

24. p_read_oe checks sr[SR_TIP] and past cr[2], leading to sda_pad_oe.

25. p_ack_oe_write checks on falling sr[SR_TIP] with past cr[3], implying sda_pad_oe.

26. p_ack_oe_read checks falling sr[SR_TIP] with past cr[2], and sda_pad_oe == cr[4].

Now, need to identify duplicates or overlapping conditions.

Assertions 2 and 10 are the same, just syntax difference (ctr[7] == 0 vs 1'b0). Keep one.

Similarly, valid_start (13) and start_oe (21) overlap but valid_start adds scl_pad_o condition. Are they duplicates? No, because the conditions differ. So both are unique.

wr_data_phase (11) and wr_oe (19) have different conditions. 11 includes cr[2], sr[3], and $past(sr[3],1), while 19 uses cr[2] and sr[3]. So they check different scenarios.

Similarly, some properties use localparam SR_TIP = 3. sr[3] is SR_TIP. So assertions using sr[3] are equivalent to those using SR_TIP. For example, assertion 7's sr[3] is the same as SR_TIP.

Need to check if any of the properties with localparams are duplicates of prior ones. For example, p_write_oe vs wr_oe. p_write_oe checks sr[SR_TIP] (sr[3]) and $past(cr[3]), leading to !sda_pad_oe. wr_oe checks cr[2] && sr[3] leading to !sda_pad_oe. Different conditions, so unique.

Other properties like p_ack_oe_write and p_ack_oe_read involve falling edge of sr[SR_TIP], which is different from other assertions.

The goal is to retain all unique ones. Also, check for any missing. The user wants maximum retention, so unless two assertions are exactly the same (same conditions and implications), they should be kept.

Now, list out all unique ones:

1. Width check: already present as first assertion.

2. (ctr[7] == 0) |-> sda_pad_oe

3. $fell(arst_i) |-> sda_pad_oe

4. sr[2] |=> sda_pad_oe

5. sr[2] |-> sda_pad_oe

6. $rose(sr[4]) |-> !sda_pad_oe (also in start_oe and valid_start)

Wait, start_oe is the same as assertion 6? Let's check:

Assertion 6: $rose(sr[4]) |-> !sda_pad_oe

property start_oe: $rose(sr[4]) |-> !sda_pad_oe

Yes, same. So these are duplicates.

Similarly, valid_start includes scl_pad_o in the condition. So different from assertion 6. So valid_start is unique.

So need to check for duplicates in the list.

Another example: property valid_stop (14) and assertion 8. Assertion 8: $fell(sr[4]) |-> sda_pad_oe. valid_stop adds scl_pad_o. So different, hence unique.

Now, compile the final list, ensuring each is unique and covers different scenarios.

The final list should include:

- The width assertion.
- All the others, unless they are exact duplicates.

Looking back at the original list, the user provided many assertions. Need to check:

Is there any assertion that checks sda_pad_oe's width? Yes, the first one.

Check for duplicates:

Assertion 2 and 10 are the same, so only keep one.

From the list:

""assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) (ctr[7] == 1'b0) |-> sda_pad_oe);""

But in the list, the first is (ctr[7]==0) and the 10th is (ctr[7]==1'b0). Since 0 and 1'b0 are same in SV, these are duplicates. So keep one.

Now, list all remaining assertions:

1. Width check

2. (ctr[7]==0 |-> sda_pad_oe)

3. $fell(arst_i) |-> sda_pad_oe

4. sr[2] |=> sda_pad_oe

5. sr[2] |-> sda_pad_oe

6. $rose(sr[4]) |-> !sda_pad_oe (assertion 6)

7. (cr[1] && sr[3]) |-> !sda_pad_oe

8. $fell(sr[4]) |-> sda_pad_oe (assertion 8)

9. $rose(sr[2]) |-> ##[1:2] sda_pad_oe

10. property wr_data_phase (11)

11. property rd_ack_phase (12)

12. valid_start (13) with scl_pad_o

13. valid_stop (14) with scl_pad_o

14. another wr_data_phase (15) same as 11? Let me check: same code, yes. So duplicate.

Similarly, rd_ack_phase (16) same as 12. So duplicates.

valid_start/valid_stop (17) same as 13/14. So duplicates.

p_scl_stretch (18) unique.

wr_oe (19) unique.

rd_oe (20) unique.

start_oe (21) same as assertion 6.

p_write_oe (22's first) unique.

p_read_oe (23) unique.

p_ack_oe_write (24) unique.

p_ack_oe_read (25) unique.

So in the user's list, they have:

Original list has:

1. Width assertion

2. ctr[7]==0

3. $fell(arst_i |-> sda_pad_oe

4. sr[2] |=> sda_pad_oe

5. sr[2] |-> sda_pad_oe

6. $rose(sr[4}) |-> !sda_pad_oe

7. (cr[1] && sr[3}) |-> !sda_pad_oe

8. $fell(sr[4}) |-> sda_pad_oe

9. $rose(sr[2}) |-> ##[1:2] sda_pad_oe

10. ctr[7]==1'b0 (same as 2)

Then properties like valid_start, valid_stop, etc.

So to compile all unique ones:

First, include the width check.

Then assertions 2-9 (excluding 10 as duplicate).

Then the properties:

wr_data_phase (11)

rd_ack_phase (12)

valid_start (13)

valid_stop (14)

p_scl_stretch (18)

wr_oe (19)

rd_oe (20)

p_write_oe (22)

p_read_oe (23)

p_ack_oe_write (24)

p_ack_oe_read (25)

But need to check if these properties are already covered by earlier assertions. For example, valid_start is similar to assertion 6 but with scl_pad_o. Since the conditions are different, they are both valid.

Another example: wr_oe in property (19) is (cr[2] && sr[3}) |-> !sda_pad_oe. This might not be covered by earlier assertions. So it's unique.

Similarly, p_write_oe uses $past(cr[3}), etc.

The key is that each of these assertions checks different conditions leading to sda_pad_oe's value, hence they are all unique and valid.

The final list should include all these, removing exact duplicates and ensuring the width check is present.

So the final list will have:

1. Width assertion

2. ctr[7]==0 |-> sda_pad_oe

3. $fell(arst_i) |-> sda_pad_oe

4. sr[2] |=> sda_pad_oe

5. sr[2] |-> sda_pad_oe

6. $rose(sr[4}) |-> !sda_pad_oe

7. (cr[1] && sr[3}) |-> !sda_pad_oe

8. $fell(sr[4}) |-> sda_pad_oe

9. $rose(sr[2}) |-> ##[1:2] sda_pad_oe

10. wr_data_phase property (11)

11. rd_ack_phase property (12)

12. valid_start property (13)

13. valid_stop property (14)

14. p_scl_stretch (18)

15. wr_oe (19)

16. rd_oe (20)

17. p_write_oe (22)

18. p_read_oe (23)

19. p_ack_oe_write (24)

20. p_ack_oe_read (25)

Plus any others that are unique and not duplicates.

Now, some of the properties in the user's list may have been repeated but formatted differently. For example, in the user's list, there's:

property wr_data_phase;\n ... same ... 

appearing twice. So need to check for duplicates in the original input list.

In the user's list, the entries 15 and 16:

15. 'property wr_data_phase;\n  @(posedge wb_clk_i) \n  (cr[2] && sr[3] && $past(sr[3],1)) |-> !sda_pad_oe; // Exclude first TIP cycle\nendproperty\nassert property (wr_data_phase);'

This is the same as entry 11. So duplicates. Similarly, entry 16 is same as 12, entry 17 same as 13, 18 same as 14.

Therefore, in the user's input list, entries 11-14 and 15-18 are duplicates. So in the final list, we should include only one instance of each unique property.

Therefore, after removing duplicates from the user's input list, but retaining all unique ones.

So the final answer should list all unique assertions from the original list, removing exact duplicates, and including the width check.

Additionally, ensure that all the properties defined with 'property' and 'assert property' are included as separate entries if they are unique.

In conclusion, the final list will include all the unique assertions provided in the user's list, including the width check, and ensuring that no two assertions are identical.

i2c,ctr,"
[Signal name]: ctr
[Description]:
    [Definition]: 8-bit wide, read/write register located at address 0x02, serving as the Control register for the I2C core.
    [Functionality]: 
        - Bit 7 (EN): I2C core enable bit. '1' enables the core; '0' disables it.
        - Bit 6 (IEN): I2C core interrupt enable bit. '1' enables interrupts; '0' disables them.
        - Bits 5:0: Reserved and must be written as zeros.
        - The register controls whether the core accepts new commands and enables interrupt generation.
    [Interconnection]: Interfaces with the internal control logic of the I2C core and works in conjunction with the Command register (CR) and Status register (SR) to manage I2C operations. It is accessed via the WISHBONE interface.
    [Additional information]: 
        - Reset value is 0x00 (core disabled and interrupts off by default).
        - The core processes new commands only when the EN bit is set. Clear EN only when no transfer is in progress (e.g., after a STOP command or when the STO bit is set).
[Related Signals]: EN, IEN, CR, SR","<think>
Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for the control register (ctr) based on the specifications provided. 

First, I need to understand the ctr register's role. It's an 8-bit read/write register at address 0x02. The key bits are EN (bit 7) and IEN (bit 6), with bits 5:0 reserved. The reset value is 0x00, meaning the core starts disabled with interrupts off. Reserved bits must be written as zeros, and the core only processes commands when EN is set.

Starting with width checks: The register is 8 bits, so an assertion to verify that makes sense.

Next, connectivity. When the WISHBONE interface writes to address 0x02, the ctr should update. But since the WISHBONE interface takes 2 cycles, I need to account for that. Also, the reserved bits (5:0) must be masked to zero during writes. So, any write should result in ctr being the input data ANDed with 0xC0 (to clear bits 5:0).

Functionality-wise, the reserved bits should always read as zero. Also, after any reset (synchronous or asynchronous), ctr should reset to 0x00. The EN bit can't be cleared if a transfer is in progress (TIP bit in SR is set), so an assertion to check that EN isn't disabled during an active transfer is needed. Additionally, the interrupt enable (IEN) should trigger an interrupt output when the interrupt flag (IF) is set.

I also need to handle both types of resets. The spec mentions an asynchronous reset (arst_i) and a synchronous reset (wb_rst_i). The assertions should check that ctr initializes correctly in both cases.

Wait, the WISHBONE write cycle takes two clock cycles. So the write assertion should check that the update happens after the second cycle, which is when wb_ack_o is asserted. That's important for timing accuracy.

Another point: The spec says that writes to reserved bits must be zero. So, during a write transaction, the data's lower 6 bits should be zero. An assertion to enforce that would ensure compliance.

Putting it all together, the SVAs should cover width, connectivity with proper timing, reserved bits handling, reset conditions, EN safety, and interrupt generation. Each assertion needs to disable during reset to avoid false negatives.

I need to make sure that the asynchronous reset uses the ARST_LVL parameter to check the correct polarity. For example, if ARST_LVL is 0, the reset is active low, so the assertion triggers when arst_i is 0.

Also, the EN bit safety check should ensure that if EN is cleared, the TIP bit in the status register (sr[3]) is not set. That prevents disabling the core during an active transfer.

Finally, all assertions should be written in SystemVerilog, using the correct syntax and signals from the WISHBONE interface and other related signals like sr (status register).
</think>

```systemverilog
// Width assertion: Verify CTR register is 8-bit wide
assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(ctr) == 8);

// Connectivity: Valid WISHBONE writes update CTR with reserved bits masked
property p_ctr_write;

  (wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && (wb_adr_i == 2'h02))
  ##1 (wb_ack_o) // WISHBONE 2-cycle transaction

**Key Features:**
1. **WISHBONE Protocol Compliance:** Uses 2-cycle transaction timing with `##1 (wb_ack_o)`
2. **Reserved Bit Handling:** Dual checks for write-time zero requirement and read-time stability
3. **Reset Coverage:** Unified assertion for both synchronous (wb_rst_i) and asynchronous (arst_i) resets
4. **State Safety:** Prevents EN disable during active transfers using status register TIP bit
5. **Interrupt Validation:** Ensures proper interrupt generation when enabled
6. **Parameterized Async Reset:** Uses ARST_LVL parameter without hardcoding polarity
7. **Non-Intrusive Checks:** All properties disable during reset conditions

This set provides complete coverage of the control register's specified behavior while maintaining strict protocol compliance and design safety constraints.","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract all unique and valid SystemVerilog assertions related to the signal 'ctr' from the provided list. The key points to consider are uniqueness, validity, and ensuring maximum retention of relevant assertions. Also, they emphasized including width checks and not modifying the assertions.

First, I'll go through each assertion in the list and check if it mentions 'ctr'. The signal in question is 'ctr', which from the documentation is likely the Control Register. The register has bits EN (bit 7), IEN (bit 6), and reserved bits 5:0.

Looking at the assertions:

1. ""assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(ctr) == 8);""  
   This checks the width of 'ctr' is 8 bits. Must include this as per instructions.

2. ""property p_ctr_write_connectivity... (ctr == ...)""  
   Checks that after writing to address 2'h02 (Control Register), 'ctr' matches the written data masked with 0xC0 (bits 7 and 6). Also, the second version waits for wb_ack_o. Are these duplicates? They have the same purpose but slightly different conditions. Both should be considered unique because one includes the ack delay.

3. ""property p_ctr_reserved_zero... (ctr[5:0] == 6'h0)""  
   Ensures reserved bits are zero. Important for functionality.

4. ""property p_en_clear_safety... $fell(ctr[7])...""  
   Relates to EN bit (bit 7) being cleared safely. Valid for 'ctr'.

5. ""property p_ien_interrupt... ctr[6]...""  
   Checks IEN bit (bit 6) and interrupt. Valid.

6. ""property p_ctr_reset... (ctr == 8'h00)""  
   Checks reset sets 'ctr' to zero. Another version checks async reset via arst_i. These are two separate properties and both valid.

7. ""property p_ctr_reserved_write... (wb_dat_i[5:0] == 6'h0)""  
   Ensures writes to reserved bits must be zero. Different from p_ctr_reserved_zero which checks the register's bits, this checks the input data. Both are necessary.

8. ""property p_ctr_reserved_read... (ctr[5:0] == 6'h0)""  
   Same as p_ctr_reserved_zero? The user might have meant to check that the reserved bits are read as zero, but the name is different. However, looking at the code, p_ctr_reserved_zero and p_ctr_reserved_read have identical conditions. Wait, no: p_ctr_reserved_zero checks that the ctr bits are zero, while p_ctr_reserved_read is similar but may be redundant. However, the user list shows both as separate. Need to check if they are duplicates.

Wait, looking at the provided list:

""property p_ctr_reserved_zero;\n  ... (ctr[5:0] == 6'h0);\nendproperty""

""property p_ctr_reserved_read;\n  ... (ctr[5:0] == 6'h0);\nendproperty""

These are the same except for the property names. So they are duplicates in terms of the condition. But the user may have intended them as separate, perhaps one for write and one for read. Wait, p_ctr_reserved_write checks that when writing, the data's lower bits are zero, while p_ctr_reserved_read (or p_ctr_reserved_zero) checks that the stored ctr's lower bits remain zero. So in the list provided, both are present but under different names and different properties. Therefore, both are valid and should be retained as separate assertions.

Then, the other assertions not mentioning 'ctr' should be excluded. For example, assertions about 'txr', 'rxr', 'scl_pad_oe', etc., are irrelevant here.

So compiling the list:

- Width assertion: Must be included.
- Two versions of p_ctr_write_connectivity (with and without ack wait). Are they both valid? The user says to maximize retained assertions, so include both if they are different. One has ""##1 (wb_ack_o)"" which accounts for the WISHBONE ack in the second cycle. The other doesn't. So they're different properties, both related to ctr write connectivity. However, checking the user list, there are two entries for p_ctr_write_connectivity with slight differences. The user might have intended to have both, but perhaps the second is a corrected version. However, according to the user's instruction, we should include all unique ones. So if two assertions have the same name but different contents, they are considered duplicates and only the latest or correct one is kept. Wait, in the provided list, there are two properties named p_ctr_write_connectivity. The first is:

""property p_ctr_write_connectivity;\n  ... |=> (ctr == ...);""

The second one adds ""##1 (wb_ack_o)"" in the antecedent. But in SystemVerilog, properties with the same name would override. However, in the user's list, they are separate entries. So in reality, these are two separate properties with the same name but different implementations. This is a conflict. However, the user provided them as separate entries, so perhaps they are typos. But to follow the user's instruction to ""extract all unique and valid assertions"", perhaps the two p_ctr_write_connectivity entries are considered duplicates and only one should be kept. But looking at the code, the first one doesn't wait for wb_ack_o, while the second does. The WISHBONE specification says that writes take two cycles, with the ack in the second cycle. Therefore, the correct version should wait for the ack. So the second version is more accurate. But the user says not to modify the assertions, just to extract them. Therefore, both should be included as separate entries. However, in the user's list, both have the same property name, which is invalid in SystemVerilog. So perhaps it's a mistake, but the user provided them as separate. Therefore, the user might have intended them as two separate assertions, despite the same name. But the problem is that in real code, you can't have two properties with the same name. So this is likely an error in the user's input list. However, per the user's instruction, we are to extract all unique assertions from the list provided, so perhaps treat them as separate even though they share a name. But that's not correct. Therefore, perhaps it's a mistake, and the user intended two different properties. Alternatively, the second one is a corrected version, and the first is obsolete. However, since the user wants maximum retention, we should include both but note the conflict. But the user's instruction says to extract all unique ones. The uniqueness here is by the content, not the name. So if two properties have the same content, they are duplicates, even if names differ. But in this case, the two p_ctr_write_connectivity have different contents. So they are two separate assertions. Wait, but in the user's list, the first p_ctr_write_connectivity is:

(wb_we_i && ...) |=> (ctr == ...)

The second has:

(wb_we_i && ...) ##1 (wb_ack_o) |=> (ctr == ...)

These are different antecedents, hence different properties. So both should be considered unique and retained. So even though they have the same property name, they are separate in the user's input, so we should include them as separate assertions.

But in SystemVerilog, having two properties with the same name is illegal, so this might be an error in the input. However, per the user's instruction, we are to extract all assertions as provided, so we should include both, even if they have the same name.

But wait, looking at the actual code:

In the user's provided list, the first is:

""property p_ctr_write_connectivity;\n ... (wb_adr_i == 2'h02)) \n  |=> (ctr == ...);""

The second:

""property p_ctr_write_connectivity;\n ... (wb_adr_i == 2'h02)) \n ##1 (wb_ack_o) ... |=> ...""

They are conflicting. Therefore, this is a problem. However, as per the user's instruction, we need to extract all unique ones from the list. But since the user has two entries with the same property name but different bodies, they are two different assertions in the list. Therefore, the user may have copy-pasted a corrected version, but we need to treat them as separate? No, because the names are the same, but in reality, they would overwrite each other. But the user wants us to ""extract all unique and valid assertions from this list"". So perhaps the way to handle this is to include both, but note that they have the same name. However, the user's original list includes them as separate entries, so perhaps they should be considered as separate despite the name clash. But that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the second one to replace the first. But as per instructions, we are not to modify the assertions, just extract them. Therefore, the answer must include both as separate entries, even though they have the same name. However, the user's question is to extract unique assertions. Unique would mean based on content. So if two assertions have the same content, they are duplicates. But in this case, the content is different. Therefore, they are unique. Therefore, both should be retained.

But in practice, having two properties with the same name is invalid. However, the user's input list includes them, so according to the instructions, they should be included as they are.

Therefore, the final list of assertions for 'ctr' would include:

1. Width check: $bits(ctr) == 8
2. Both p_ctr_write_connectivity properties (with and without ack)
3. p_ctr_reserved_zero and p_ctr_reserved_read (but they check the same thing? Wait no: reserved_write checks that during a write, the input data's lower bits are zero, while reserved_zero checks that the ctr's lower bits are always zero. These are different checks. So both are valid.
4. p_ctr_reset (sync and async)
5. p_en_clear_safety (checks EN bit)
6. p_ien_interrupt (checks IEN bit)
7. p_ctr_reserved_write (input data check)
8. p_ctr_write (another version)
9. p_ctr_reset_sync and p_ctr_reset_async

Wait, let's go through each entry:

Original list entries related to ctr:

1. 'assert property (@(posedge wb_clk_i) $bits(ctr) == 8);'  
   Keep.

2. ""property p_ctr_write_connectivity... |=> (ctr == ...);""  
   Keep.

3. ""property p_ctr_reserved_zero...""  
   Keep.

4. ""property p_en_clear_safety...""  
   Relates to ctr[7], keep.

5. ""property p_ien_interrupt...""  
   Relates to ctr[6], keep.

6. ""property p_ctr_reset... |=> (ctr == 8'h00);""  
   Keep.

7. ""property p_ctr_write_connectivity... ##1 (wb_ack_o)...""  
   Keep as separate from 2.

8. ""property p_ctr_reserved_write... (wb_dat_i[5:0] == 6'h0);""  
   Keep.

9. ""property p_ctr_reserved_read... (ctr[5:0] == 6'h0);""  
   Same as p_ctr_reserved_zero? The code for p_ctr_reserved_zero and p_ctr_reserved_read are the same? Let me check:

p_ctr_reserved_zero: checks ctr[5:0] == 0.

p_ctr_reserved_read: same check. So they are duplicates. But looking at the user's list, these are two separate entries with different property names. So in the user's list, they are separate, hence should be considered unique even if the condition is same. Therefore, include both.

10. 'property p_en_safety... $fell(ctr[7])...'  
    Keep.

11. ""property p_ctr_reset... $changed(arst_i...""  
    Different reset condition, keep.

12. ""property p_ctr_write... |=> (ctr == ...);""  
    Similar to write_connectivity but perhaps with different name. Check if the condition is same. No, in this one, it's a general write without address check. Wait, no: the original p_ctr_write_connectivity checks for address 2'h02 (Control Register address?), whereas p_ctr_write may not. Wait, looking at the code:

Original entries:

""property p_ctr_write_connectivity... (wb_adr_i == 2'h02)... |=> (ctr == ...);""

Another property named p_ctr_write: same check? Let me check:

""property p_ctr_write... (wb_adr_i == 2'h02)) |=> (ctr == (wb_dat_i & 8'hC0));""

Ah, no, looking at the actual code of the user's list:

The property named p_ctr_write is:

property p_ctr_write;
  @(posedge wb_clk_i) disable iff (wb_rst_i || (arst_i != ARST_LVL))
  (wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && (wb_adr_i == 2'h02)) |=> (ctr == (wb_dat_i & 8'hC0));
endproperty

Which is the same as the first p_ctr_write_connectivity except the name. So this is a duplicate of the first p_ctr_write_connectivity but with a different property name. So this is a different property, but same condition. Therefore, the user has two different-named properties with the same check. Therefore, they are duplicates. But according to the user's list, they are separate entries, so we should consider them as unique if their names differ. But actually, they are the same check. Therefore, they are duplicates and only one should be retained. However, the user's instruction says to maximize the number of retained assertions, so maybe keep both. But that's incorrect. However, since the user might have intended them as separate, perhaps due to different names, even if they check the same thing, we include both. Wait, but looking at the code:

The first p_ctr_write_connectivity and the later p_ctr_write have the same code except for the name. So in the user's list, these are two separate assertions, which may be a mistake. However, the user wants all unique ones. So uniqueness is based on content. Therefore, if two assertions have the same content but different names, they are not unique and should be considered duplicates. But how can I tell? For example, p_ctr_write_connectivity and p_ctr_write may have the same conditions. If their antecedents and consequents are identical, they are duplicates. 

Looking at the code:

First p_ctr_write_connectivity:

(wb_we_i && wb_stb_i && wb_cyc_i && (wb_adr_i == 2'h02)) |=> (ctr == (wb_dat_i & 8'hC0));

p_ctr_write's code is same, except named differently.

So these two properties are duplicates in everything except name. Therefore, they are duplicates in content. Therefore, only one should be kept. However, the user provided them as separate entries. But since the user said to extract unique assertions, if two are identical except for the name, they are not unique. But since the user included them as separate entries, perhaps they intended them as separate. This is a bit confusing.

But the problem is that in SystemVerilog, property names are identifiers and must be unique. But in the user's input list, there are properties with the same name but different bodies, and different names but same bodies. This is likely an error in the user's list.

However, given the instructions to extract all unique and valid assertions from the list, considering each entry as a separate assertion, even if they are duplicates, we need to list them as they are. But to maximize the number of retained assertions, duplicate content with different names are kept. For example, if there's a property named A and another B with same code, both are kept. But if same name and different code, that's invalid. 

In this case, the user's list has two p_ctr_write_connectivity with different code. This is invalid in real code but in the user's list, they are separate. So, per the user's instructions, they should be listed as separate assertions.

But the user wants us to return all unique assertions. Unique here is per the content. So if two different properties (different code) are present, they are considered unique. But same code with different names are also considered unique.

Therefore, even if two properties have the same code but different names, they are unique entries in the list and should be retained. However, this is not the case for the two p_ctr_write_connectivity entries which have the same name but different code—this would be invalid in actual code. But in the user's list, they are present as separate entries, so they must be treated as separate.

This is a bit of a mess, but I'll proceed as per the instructions.

Final list of assertions related to 'ctr':

1. Assertion for width: $bits(ctr) == 8
2. p_ctr_write_connectivity (version 1)
3. p_ctr_write_connectivity (version 2 with ack)
4. p_ctr_reserved_zero
5. p_ctr_reserved_read
6. p_en_clear_safety
7. p_ien_interrupt
8. p_ctr_reset (version 1)
9. p_ctr_reset (version 2 with changed(arst_i))
10. p_ctr_reserved_write
11. p_ctr_write (different name, same as version 1 p_ctr_write_connectivity?)
12. p_ctr_reset_sync
13. p_ctr_reset_async
14. p_en_safety

Wait, some of these might be overlapping. For example, p_ctr_reset_sync and p_ctr_reset_async are separate properties for synchronous and asynchronous reset. They should both be retained.

Now, compiling all unique assertions, including all that mention 'ctr' and are valid.

So the final list includes all assertions that have 'ctr' in their conditions, ensuring that for each unique check (even if duplicated due to different names or conditions), they are included.

The answer should list all these assertions as per the user's original list, ensuring they are unique (no exact duplicates) but including all variations.

Okay, let's tackle generating the SVAs for the Command Register (cr) step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand all the specifications and requirements.

The cr is an 8-bit write-only register at address 0x04. The bits have specific functions:
- Bit 7 (STA): Start condition
- Bit 6 (STO): Stop condition
- Bit 5 (RD): Read operation
- Bit 4 (WR): Write operation
- Bit 3 (ACK): Acknowledge control
- Bit 0 (IACK): Interrupt acknowledge
Bits 2:1 are reserved and must be written as zeros. The command bits (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK) auto-clear after execution and read as zeros. The reset value is 0x00.

Now, considering the types of SVAs needed: width, connectivity, functionality, and reset checks.

1. **Width Check**: Ensure cr is 8 bits wide. This is straightforward using $bits.

2. **Reserved Bits**: Any write to cr must have bits 2:1 as 0. This needs an assertion during write operations.

3. **Auto-Clear of Command Bits**: After a write, STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK should clear. However, the exact timing isn't specified, but the spec says they auto-clear after execution. So, check they are 0 in the next cycle.

4. **Mutual Exclusivity**: The spec doesn't explicitly forbid STA/STO or RD/WR being set together, but typically, RD and WR shouldn't be active simultaneously. However, since the spec allows command processing, maybe only check RD/WR conflict.

5. **Interrupt Clear (IACK)**: Writing IACK should clear the interrupt flag (sr[0]). Need to check sr[0] is cleared after a write with IACK set.

6. **Reset Value**: After reset (async or sync), cr should be 0x00. Parameterize the async reset based on ARST_LVL.

7. **Reserved Bits Read**: Even though cr is write-only, if read, reserved bits should be 0. But since it's write-only, maybe this is handled by the WISHBONE interface. However, adding a read check for reserved bits ensures they aren't mistakenly used.

8. **ACK Functionality**: ACK bit (bit 3) should only affect read operations. Need to ensure that when a read is active (RD set), the ACK bit drives the SDA line correctly.

Now, structuring each assertion:

- **Width Check**: Simple assertion using $bits.
- **Reserved Bits on Write**: Check during write that bits 2:1 are 0.
- **Reserved Bits on Read**: If a read occurs, ensure bits 2:1 are 0 (though cr is write-only, this is a safety check).
- **Command Bits Auto-Clear**: After a write, check STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK are 0 in the next cycle.
- **RD/WR Conflict**: Ensure RD and WR aren't set together.
- **IACK Clears Interrupt**: After writing IACK, check sr[0] is 0 within 1-2 cycles.
- **Reset Checks**: Async and sync reset checks.
- **ACK Functionality**: Link ACK bit to SDA behavior during reads.

Potential issues from previous attempts included incorrect handling of ACK in auto-clear and missing reserved bits read check. Need to correct those.

Final SVAs should cover all these points without introducing new signals or assumptions beyond the spec.
</think>

[REASONING]
1. **Width Check**: Ensure `cr` is 8 bits.
2. **Reserved Bits**: Verify bits 2:1 are 0 on write and read.
3. **Auto-Clear**: Command bits (STA, STO, RD, WR, IACK) must clear after a write.
4. **Mutual Exclusivity**: Prevent RD and WR from being set simultaneously.
5. **Interrupt Clear**: IACK write clears interrupt flag (sr[0]) within 1-2 cycles.
6. **Reset Handling**: Check reset values for both async and sync resets.
7. **ACK Functionality**: Ensure ACK bit drives SDA correctly during reads.
